"""An event processor with an idempotent submit API. Standard library only.

Run me: ``python event_api.py`` (runs the test suite, including a real
multi-threaded double-claim test).

THE PROBLEM
-----------
A caller builds up a request incrementally (a container plus uploaded
documents), then submits it for processing. Submitting the same request twice
-- a double-click, a client retry, a redelivered webhook -- must never cause
the downstream system to be invoked twice.

TWO HALVES, DESIGNED SEPARATELY
-------------------------------
1. **The API shape.** Building a request and submitting it are different
   operations with different semantics. Build-up is mutable and repeatable;
   submission is a one-way door. Modelling them as one endpoint is what forces
   the "did I already send this?" problem into the client.
2. **The guarantee.** Deduplication is enforced twice, at two independent
   layers, because a single check is a race:
     * enqueue dedup -- a database CONSTRAINT, not a check-then-act
     * claim dedup   -- a single atomic UPDATE ... WHERE status = 'pending'

WHAT THE GUARANTEE ACTUALLY IS
------------------------------
This is **at-most-once**: a request is handled once or not at all, never
twice. A worker that dies mid-handle leaves the event claimed and unfinished,
and nothing retries it. That is a deliberate trade, not an oversight:

    at-most-once   never double-fires, may drop     <- what this builds
    at-least-once  never drops, may double-fire     <- add a lease + retry
    exactly-once   not achievable end-to-end unless the downstream effect is
                   itself idempotent; "exactly-once delivery" is marketing,
                   "effectively-once processing" is the real target

To move to at-least-once, give the claim a lease (``claimed_until``) and let a
sweeper return expired claims to pending. Then the downstream call MUST be
idempotent, because it will eventually be retried. The dedup key below is
exactly the idempotency key that makes that safe.
