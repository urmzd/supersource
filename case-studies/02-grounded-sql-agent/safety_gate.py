"""A deterministic SQL safety gate for an LLM that writes queries.

Standard library only. Run me: ``python safety_gate.py``.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
An agent that turns natural language into SQL is, structurally, a system that
lets a stranger's sentence reach your database. The gate below is what stands
in between, and the single most important property is that **it contains no
model**. It is rules over text, so it cannot be prompt-injected, cannot be
talked out of a decision, and behaves identically on every run.

The rule this encodes, which generalises far past SQL:

    NEVER LET THE MODEL BE THE ONLY SAFETY BOUNDARY.

A prompt saying "only generate SELECT statements" is a preference. A classifier
that refuses to execute anything else is a control. Prompts fail open under
adversarial input; deterministic gates fail closed.

DEFENCE IN DEPTH
----------------
This gate is one of three layers, and it is the weakest of them:

    1. this classifier          blocks writes/admin/multi-statement, caps rows
    2. a read-only connection   re-checks at the data boundary (PRAGMA
                                query_only, or a read-only DSN)
    3. a SELECT-only DB role    the only layer an application bug cannot bypass

Layer 3 is the real control; layers 1 and 2 exist to fail fast, give the model
a useful error to correct against, and protect databases where the deployment
does not control the role.

THE INTERESTING PART IS THE LEXER
---------------------------------
Naive keyword matching is wrong in both directions:

    SELECT * FROM t WHERE name = 'Begin Again'   -- contains BEGIN, is a read
    SELECT 'a;b' AS x                            -- contains ';', is ONE statement
    SELECT * INTO archive FROM users             -- leads with SELECT, WRITES
    SELECT * FROM (SELECT ... LIMIT 5)           -- has LIMIT, is NOT bounded

So the text is scanned once into two parallel strings of identical length: a
*cleaned* copy (comments blanked, literals intact) that is safe to execute, and
a *masked* copy (literal contents blanked too) that every check reads. Keywords
inside strings cannot lie to the classifier, and positions still line up.
