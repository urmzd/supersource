"""K-means three times: slow -> average -> best, one optimisation at a time.

Standard library only, no numpy. Run me: ``python kmeans_ladder.py``.

THE PROBLEM
-----------
Given n points in R^d and an integer k, partition the points into k clusters
minimising *inertia* -- the sum of squared distances from each point to the
centroid of its assigned cluster.

Exact k-means is NP-hard, so every practical answer is **Lloyd's algorithm**:
alternate two steps until nothing changes.

    1. ASSIGN  each point to its nearest centroid
    2. UPDATE  each centroid to the mean of its assigned points

Neither step can increase inertia and there are finitely many partitions, so
it always terminates -- but at a *local* optimum. That single fact is why
initialisation, not iteration, is the highest-leverage thing to fix.

THE LADDER
----------
All three implementations share one contract, so they are interchangeable and
testable against each other:

    fit(points, k, seed=...) -> (centroids, labels, inertia)

    slow     random init, sqrt distances, fixed iteration count
    average  k-means++ init, squared distances, real stopping rule,
             explicit empty-cluster repair
    best     incremental centroid maintenance and partial-distance
             abandonment -- constant-factor work on both Lloyd's steps

The asymptotic cost per iteration, O(n * k * d), never goes away in Lloyd's.
`average` attacks the NUMBER of iterations; `best` attacks the CONSTANT. They
are different levers and it is worth being explicit about which one is being
pulled.
