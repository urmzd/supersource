## 1. Vision and principles

### 1.1 What the learner builds

The learner builds **one cohesive engineering system from scratch** and owns all of it at the end: a small LLM platform. It trains a language model on a corpus it cleaned itself, serves it from a native inference engine running its own C kernels, fronts it with a Go gateway, runs long jobs on a durable execution engine it wrote, drives it with an agent SDK it wrote, deploys it on a local Kubernetes cluster, observes it end to end, and keeps it alive through incident drills and interface migrations.

The course principle is **deliver something meaningful**. Every module is a piece of that system with a real call site. Fundamentals with no call site become checked problem sets (`solve`) or optional side quests.

### 1.2 Principles

| # | Principle | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | **One system, owned end to end** | Every `build` module declares `used_by` call sites: other modules (never milestones or side quests) that call its code. A build module with no such call site fails `ss verify course` |
| P2 | **The course ships no prebuilt system** | No CLI, server, API, run script, Dockerfile, chart, or CI file is given to the learner. The course ships contracts, chapters, tests, fixtures, and hidden references |
| P3 | **Contracts at every boundary** | Every language crossing goes through a written contract (C header, `.pyi`, Rust trait, Go interface, `.proto`, OpenAPI, file format spec). Conformance suites test the contract, not an implementation |
| P4 | **Four languages, one job each** | Python: math, models, training, data, model evals. C: kernels and runtime. Rust: inference engine and fast tokenizer. Go: control plane (gateway, durable engine, agent SDK, load generator) |
| P5 | **Math becomes code** | Math modules with code have call sites: central differences become `gradcheck`, Newton becomes `rsqrt`, SVD becomes LoRA and MLA initialization, fp8 emulation becomes quantization, categorical sampling becomes the sampler. Pen-and-paper math is a `solve` set checked by SymPy |
| P6 | **Python is the semantic source of truth** | Native ports (C, Rust) are proven by differential tests against the **learner's own Python**, never against a black box |
| P7 | **Tracer bullet first, then spiral** | Pass 1 builds a thin version of every layer end to end. Each later module upgrades one component behind an unchanged contract, or changes a contract through an explicit migration chapter |
| P8 | **Nothing left on its own** | Every chapter has the six beats: Why now, Principles, Worked example, Interface and tests, Pitfalls, Where it's used next |
| P9 | **Every part ends in a milestone run through the learner's own entry points** | `ss milestone` launches the commands the learner declares in `system.toml`, never ours |
| P10 | **Tests are graded by what they catch** | The learner's own tests run against our reference with one planted fault. Mutation score is the grade |
| P11 | **Determinism by construction** | One cross-language RNG spec, one sampling op order, explicit seeds, fixed thread counts in tests, bit-exact where we define the algorithm |
| P12 | **Maintenance is taught** | Drills inject faults into the learner's running cluster. Interface migrations, dependency upgrades, and perf bisects are modules |

### 1.3 Who provides what

| Artifact | Course provides | Learner builds |
|---|---|---|
| Contracts (`tinyllm.h`, `.pyi`, Rust traits, Go interfaces, `.proto`, OpenAPI, format specs) | yes, read-only, vendored | implements them |
| Chapters (guides) | yes, in the tracks | reads them |
| Course tests, conformance and parity suites | yes, vendored at export | runs them via `ss` |
| Fixtures and oracles | yes (small committed, large via `ss fetch`) | uses them |
| Hidden reference implementations | yes, for course CI, mutation grading, and opt-in `--ref-deps`; never exported or published | never reads them unless they choose `ss show` (recorded as `spoiled`). "Hidden" is an **honor system** (D34): `course/ref/` sits in the public repo the learner clones, because `--ref-deps` and mutation grading run locally |
| Library code for every module | stubs only, written by `ss start` | yes |
| CLI, servers, HTTP API handlers, local run scripts | no | yes |
| Dockerfiles, Helm charts, kind config, Tiltfile, CI | no | yes |
| Own test suites | annotated exemplars | yes, graded by mutation testing |
| Docs (ADRs, C4, runbooks, model card, threat model, postmortems) | templates | yes |

### 1.4 Naming

The learner names the system once: `ss course init --name <system>`. The name is stored in `system.toml`. Course text uses the literal placeholder `<system>`. **Contract identifiers never contain the name**, so conformance suites run unchanged against any learner's repo.

| Thing | Uses `<system>`? | Example with `<system>=forge` |
|---|---|---|
| Repo directory, umbrella CLI binary, Helm release prefix, k8s namespace, kind context | yes | `forge/`, `forge`, `forge-gateway`, `ns/forge`, `kind-forge` |
| Python packages | no | `tinyllm`, `corpus` |
| Rust crates | no | `tl-ds`, `tl-tok`, `tl-py`, `tl-sys`, `tl-engine`, `tl-serve` |
| Go module | no | `tinyllm` (packages `tinyllm/gateway/...`); the vendored contracts are a separate module with a dotted path, `supersource.urmzd.com/tl/contracts`, required through a `replace` to `../contracts/go` in `go/go.mod` |
| Helm values schemas | no | `contracts/helm/{gateway,engine,durable,worker,agent}.values.schema.json` |
| C library, header, symbol prefix | no | `libtinyllm`, `tinyllm.h`, `tl_` |
| Proto packages | no | `tl.engine.v1`, `tl.kv.v1`, `tl.control.v1`, `tl.durable.v1`, `tl.raft.v1` |
| Env var prefix, OTel attribute namespace | no | `TL_` (including the API key, `TL_API_KEY`), `tl.*` |

### 1.5 Decisions (merge resolutions)

The five source sections disagreed on ids, paths, and some architecture. Each line records the choice and the reason. These are binding for the rest of this document.

| # | Decision | Rejected alternative(s) | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | **Ids**: math `Mcc.n`, spine `Lp.n`, capstones `C1`/`C2`, solve sets `S-Mcc` split into lettered parts by pass (`S-M07a`), systems, primers, and practices `<area>.NN` (`lang ds rt data dur gw ag load dep obs ops craft ethics review field iv`), side quests `sq.<slug>`, milestones `MS-<slug>` | `llm.p07.rope` (A), single-letter tracks `L8.3`/`W2.4`/`P1.3` (D), `tinyllm.p0.01`/`math.04.01` (E) | Short ids that read as the part or area; one grammar for the harness regex (5.2) |
| D2 | **Learner repo top level** `python/ c/ rust/ go/ deploy/ docs/` (A), Python internals per the math/ML catalog, Go packages per the systems catalog, no Go `internal/` | `tinyllm/ kernels/ engine/ control/` (B, E); `py/ rs/` (C, D) | Course tests must import learner Go packages, which `internal/` forbids; language-named roots make the overlay a path mapping |
| D3 | Harness manifest is **`system.toml`**; service runtime config is **`runtime.toml`** | `course.toml` (A, E), `supersource.toml` (C) | It describes the learner's system, not the course; two files with two jobs |
| D4 | **Fixed contract names** (1.4): Go module `tinyllm`, contracts module `supersource.urmzd.com/tl/contracts`, crates `tl-ds tl-tok tl-py tl-sys tl-engine tl-serve` | Go `github.com/<you>/<system>/go` (A), crates `tl-tensor tl-sampler tl-kv` (D), `tl-tokenizer tl-server` (B) | Tests import fixed names; A's own rule said contract ids never carry the system name |
| D5 | **Data plane is HTTP.** Every engine serves the OpenAI subset over HTTP+SSE; the gateway proxies SSE. gRPC is internal only: `tl.engine.v1.EngineControl` (Prefill, Info, Cancel, Drain), `tl.kv.v1`, `tl.control.v1`, `tl.durable.v1`, `tl.raft.v1` | Gateway to engine over gRPC `Generate` (A) | The Part 10 milestone can run OpenAI conformance against the engine before any gateway exists; the tracer engine is plain HTTP |
| D6 | KV transfer is gRPC `tl.kv.v1` with content-hash dedup (`HasBlocks`, `PushKv`) | framed TCP `TLKV` (C), per-layer proto (B) | Dedup by hash reuses the prefix-cache hash; one RPC stack |
| D7 | **Rust owns the model graph** (L10.1 forward over C kernels via `tl-sys`); C owns kernels and runtime | C full forward `tl_model_forward` in `model.c` (B) | Avoids a third copy of the model graph; the Rust engine is substantive. L9.7 becomes the Python `--backend c` dispatch that proves kernels before Rust exists |
| D8 | Python reaches Rust through **PyO3** (`tl-py`, module `tinyllm_rs`); Python reaches C through **ctypes** | `tok.h` C ABI cdylib (A) | One binding per pair; PyO3 releases the GIL for batch encode |
| D9 | Python talks to the platform **only through the subprocess activity contract** (2.8). The Go worker execs Python. Two named exceptions: OTLP telemetry export (obs.05), and the optional L12 rollout client, which calls the engine's HTTP API | Python gRPC worker client (C dur.09); HTTP durable client API `durable.v1.yaml` (C) | Training and data stay testable without a cluster; no Python proto toolchain; one durable protocol (gRPC) |
| D10 | **RNG**: PCG32 (XSH-RR 64/32), SplitMix64 for seed derivation, `uniform_f64` from two u32 draws (53 bits) | xoshiro256\*\* (D); 24-bit float (B); A's `<<21 ^` mix | One spec; `M06.3` moves to Pass 2 because `L0` APIs take `rng: PCG32` |
| D11 | Sampling op order: penalties, temperature, top-k, top-p, min-p, f64 softmax, one uniform, inverse CDF; ties to the lowest id; `temperature == 0` is greedy | per-section variants | Bit-identical Python and Rust streams |
| D12 | **C ABI**: umbrella `tinyllm.h` over per-unit headers; raw pointers plus explicit dims; constructors return `tl_status` with an out param; `_create`/`_destroy`; positive status codes; allocator hook and thread-local `tl_last_error` | `tl_tensor` struct API (A); negative codes (C) | ctypes-friendly, per-unit ownership, fault injection via the allocator hook |
| D13 | KV block pool API from the systems catalog (`rt.04`), block hash = chained FNV-1a 64 over full blocks only, KV format v1 f16; v2 fp8 e4m3 with per-(layer, head) scales arrives only through the `craft.13` migration. Both share one export envelope (2.9) | xxh64 (C), int8 v2 (A) | FNV-1a is hand-implementable in every language; fp8 reuses `M09.4`; shipping v2 early would leave the migration nothing to migrate |
| D14 | Runtime pieces: `L9.0` dissolves into `rt.01` to `rt.03`; `L8.3` is the Python paged cache over `rt.04` | three overlapping owners (B L9.0/L8.3, C rt.*, E p9.02/p9.06) | One owner per unit |
| D15 | **Ownership unit is a source file** in every language. A later module may take over a unit with `upgrades = [...]`; the earlier module's tests become its smoke regression | crate- or package-level units (D) | All of `tl-engine` would otherwise be one module; `upgrades` is how the spiral works |
| D16 | **Entry points are learner territory**: CLI mains, server mains, `go/cmd/*`, `deploy/`, `docs/`. They are never overlaid and are verified only by milestones, conformance suites, and artifact checks. `--ref-deps` substitutes library units only | `--ref-deps loadgen` substituting a binary (B) | Decision 2: no prebuilt system |
| D17 | Data formats: parquet text shards and llm.c `.bin` token streams (A). Data modules renumbered `data.01` fetch to `data.09` workflow | tokens in parquet (C), `.bin + .idx` (E) | The training loader memory-maps a flat token stream |
| D18 | Metrics follow OTel GenAI semantic conventions plus `tl.*`; services also expose Prometheus `/metrics` on the health port (`:9464` in k8s, `{health_port}` locally) for tests. SLO defaults from A, scaled by `ss bench --calibrate`, which runs inside the cluster for SLOs checked on kind | `tl_engine_ttft_seconds` (C), `tinyllm_ttft_seconds` (D) | One naming source; portable budgets |
| D19 | API keys `tl_<id>_<secret>`, stored as HMAC-SHA256 with a pepper | `tl-<base32>` plus SHA-256 (A) | O(1) lookup by id; pepper limits damage from a leaked key file |
| D20 | **Placement**: `L11.1` (mixed precision, accumulation, recompute) is core before `C1`; `L11.2` and `L11.3` optional, tensor and pipeline parallelism side quests; `L12` post-training optional after `C1` | core post-training in the agents pass (E) | `C1` needs `L11.1` to finish on a laptop; a 10M TinyStories model cannot drive a tool-calling agent, so agents use the learner's gateway serving SmolLM2-135M-Instruct (a fetched third-party model, labelled as such in the model card) on the learner's engine, or a frontier provider through the same `Provider` |
| D21 | Prefix bloom in heartbeats dropped; routing is consistent hash with bounded loads plus queue depth | bloom-refined routing (A) | Fewer moving parts; kept as side quest `sq.prefix-bloom` |
| D22 | **Course layout** is the harness section's `course/` tree with one `course/modules/<ID>.toml` per module and a generated `modules.tsv`; `course/ref/` mirrors the learner layout path for path | `modules.tsv` as hand-edited source (E); bundled `course/modules/<layer>/<nn>/CHAPTER.md` (C) | TOML carries smoke tests, learner-test grading, and `upgrades`; chapters belong in tracks |
| D23 | **Chapter homes** in tracks: spine `ml/08-tinyllm/pNN-<slug>/NN-<slug>.md`; new math topics `00-precalculus`, `08-matrix-calculus-and-autodiff`, `09-numerical-methods-and-floating-point`, `10-optimization`, `11-information-theory`; ethics as new top-level track `responsible-ai/`; durable chapters in `ai-platform-engineering/05-durable-orchestration-and-workers/` | `ml/tinyllm/pNN/mNN/README.md` (A); ethics under craftsmanship (A); durable under `infrastructure/` (A) | Matches existing numbering; decision 9 calls ethics a track; decision 12 merges infra/03 into ai-platform/05 |
| D24 | The guide (front door, system map, pass intros, milestone pages) lives in `paths/course*/` | guide in `course/` | Existing rule: a path holds its manifest, README, and material about the path |
| D25 | **Milestones** use one namespace `MS-*`: part milestones (`MS-L0`...), component milestones (`MS-corpus`, `MS-gateway`, `MS-durable-ha`, ...), and pass gates `MS-P0` to `MS-P11` composed of them. Milestones are not module kinds | `MS-L0` only (B), `M-engine` (C), `M0`...`M11` (E), `L8.M` (D) | Keeps every check and gives passes a single gate |
| D26 | Test `KIND` vocabulary: `unit boundary property statistical differential golden gradcheck learning conformance fault regression bench eval` | B's letter codes, C's tiers | One tag set for lint and `ss tests` |
| D27 | Fixtures: at most 50 MiB committed, at most 8 MiB per file, a committed-fixture budget per authoring batch (section 9); the TinyStories slices, token streams, and tiny HF models are pinned assets fetched by `ss fetch`; maintainer generators in `course/oracle/` | 20 MB (A), 60 MB (B), 2 MiB per file (D) | Committing the corpora and tiny models alone would use the whole budget and grow history on every regeneration |
| D28 | `ss course init` creates the learner repo (default `.scratchpad/course/`, override `SS_COURSE_HOME`); `ss export` produces the standalone repo with vendored tests | `ss export --name` as the creation step (A, E) | The learner works in a git repo from day one; export adds vendoring |
| D29 | Practice exercises stay as standalone warm-up drills with a pointer to their course module. Hash maps consolidate: `c/02` becomes the `ds.02` baseline, the `rust/03` README row points to `ds.05` (authored fresh), `cpp/03` is archived, zig and java hash-map rows are dropped, `swiss-table/` is removed | retiring the C drills (E) | Only the C and C++ drills have references and pass CI. The Rust, Go, Python, Zig, Java, Scala, and TypeScript build directories hold a README exercise list only, so their mappings are README pointers, not code |
| D30 | Load generator is Go (`load.01`); `ml/04-llm-systems/serving-and-load/code/loadgen.py` becomes reading | Python loadgen | Control plane is Go (decision 3) |
| D31 | **Spine content without a call site stays optional.** ELMo (`L3.5`), T5 span corruption (`L6.4`), and the ALiBi part of `L7.4` are optional modules with side-quest call sites. Unigram (`L1.4`, C1 tokenizer ablation) and ELECTRA (`L6.3`, alternative classification backbone in the model zoo) are core | everything in decision 5 core | Decision 1 outranks the topic list of decision 5: a module with no call site in the final system is optional |
| D32 | **The tracer is byte-level**: vocabulary of 256 ids equal to UTF-8 bytes, no `tokenizer.json`; `config.json` declares `tl_tokenizer = "bytes"`. Every engine keeps serving `tl_arch = bigram` with the byte tokenizer, so the tracer smoke stays green for the whole course | char tokenizer in Pass 1 (B); BPE with zero merges (critic) | No P1 tokenizer module is needed and the Rust tracer needs no JSON parser |
| D33 | **Usage-policy classifier** = a linear head (L6.5 `SequenceClassifier(pool='mean')` fitted with M07.7 IRLS) over the learner engine's `/v1/embeddings`, exported as `formats/linear-head.schema.json` and evaluated in Go by `gw.08` | Python-served BERT classifier; new engine `/v1/classify` | Python never serves HTTP (D9); no new engine endpoint; Go evaluates a dot product |
| D34 | **References are an honor system**: `course/ref`, `course/mutants`, and solve keys live in the public repo, are never exported or published, and reading them is recorded only through `ss show` | private submodule fetched by course CI | `--ref-deps` and mutation grading must run on the learner's machine |
| D35 | **Course tests assert through frozen helpers** (`course/tests/_lib`, `ss_test.h`, `tl-contracts::testing`, `contracts/go/testing`) and construct RNGs from the frozen PCG32 there. The learner's own `gradcheck`, tolerance helpers, and PCG32 decide only their own modules' verdicts | course tests calling the learner's `gradcheck` and `tolerance` through the overlay | A gradcheck that always returns ok would otherwise pass every later test |
| D36 | **Model zoo**: every `tl_arch` family loads through the checkpoint contract and is evaluated by `L6.7`'s zoo suite, which the `EvalSuite` workflow (`dur.11`) runs. This is the call site of `L2.*`, `L3.*`, `L4.*`, `L5.5`, and `L6.1` to `L6.3` | "referenced by a milestone step" as a call site | Decision 1: a real call site in the final system, not a milestone |
| D37 | **Engine scope**: speculative decoding (`L10.8`) and tool calls with constrained JSON decoding (`L10.9`) are core engine modules; multi-LoRA serving is `sq.multi-lora` | spec decoding only in Python; multi-LoRA as optional `L10.8` | `L8.6` and `L8.7` need a production call site; MS-agent needs `tool_calls` from the learner's engine |
| D38 | **Language and tool primers** `lang.01` to `lang.11` precede the first module that uses each language or tool; chapters in `software-craftsmanship/12-language-and-tool-primers/` | assume prior fluency | A learner starting from high-school algebra meets C, Rust, Go, Docker, and Kubernetes in Pass 1 |

## 2. The system

| 8 | `tl-engine` | Rust | `rust/crates/tl-engine/` (lib target) | mmap safetensors, Llama-family forward over C kernels (plus the tracer `bigram` arch), sampler (bit-identical with Python given the same logits), prefix cache, block manager, scheduler (continuous batching, chunked prefill, preemption), quantized weights, speculative decoding, constrained JSON decoding, KV transfer, heartbeat client, roles `unified`/`prefill`/`decode` | L8.4, L10.1 to L10.4, L10.6, L10.8, L10.9 |

| 10 | gateway | Go | `go/gateway/...`, `go/cmd/gateway` | auth, rate limits, usage policy, response cache, SSE proxy, worker registry, routing (consistent hash with bounded loads, cascades, failover, disaggregated orchestration), usage ledger, admin API | `gw.*` |
| 11 | durable | Go | `go/durable/...`, `go/cmd/durable` | Temporal-like server: segmented WAL event log, task queues with visibility timeout, fenced leases, retries, DLQ, durable timers, signals, history replay; optional Raft HA | `dur.*` |
| 12 | durable SDK and worker | Go | `go/durable/{workflow,activity,worker}`, `go/workflows/`, `go/activities/`, `go/cmd/worker` | deterministic replay executor, `ExecuteActivity`, `Sleep`, signals, `SideEffect`, `GetVersion`, `ContinueAsNew`; workflows `CorpusBuild` (data.09), `TrainRun` and `EvalSuite` (dur.11), `ModelRelease` (dur.12), `AgentRun` (ag.05); subprocess activity runner for Python (dur.09); PromQL and route-update activities (dur.12) | `dur.*`, `data.09`, `ag.05` |
| 13 | agent SDK | Go | `go/agent/...` | saige-shaped: `Provider` (OpenAI-compatible, pointed at the learner's gateway or a frontier API), streaming loop with typed deltas, tools, gates, durable runs, RAG (BM25 + vectors + RRF + MMR), eval (scorers, LLM judge, pairwise judge, A/B experiments) | `ag.*` |

| 17 | deploy | YAML, Docker | `deploy/` | Dockerfiles, Helm chart per component, kind cluster, Tiltfile, OTel collector, dashboards, SLO rules | `dep.*`, `obs.*` |

Python never speaks gRPC or HTTP to the platform. It reaches the rest of the system through files, ctypes, PyO3, and subprocess exit codes. That boundary is deliberate: the training stack is testable without a cluster. Two exceptions are named in D9: Python exports OTLP telemetry to the collector, and the optional L12 GRPO rollout client calls the engine's HTTP API.

The C4 version of this diagram (context, containers, engine components) is learner-written in D2 under `docs/c4/` (`craft.09`). The reference version lives in `course/ref/docs/c4/` and is never exported.

### 2.3 Interface boundary matrix

All contract paths are relative to `course/contracts/` (vendored to the learner's `contracts/`). All suites are under `course/conformance/`.

| From | To | Mechanism | Contract | Conformance suite |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Python | C | ctypes over `libtinyllm.{dylib,so}` | `c/include/tinyllm.h` | `abi/` (Python drives each function against numpy; struct layout via `ctypes.sizeof`) |
| Python | Rust | PyO3 module `tinyllm_rs` | `py/tinyllm_rs.pyi` | `parity/tokenizer.bpe`, `parity/bloom` |
| Rust engine | C | static link via `tl-sys` | `c/include/tinyllm.h` | same ABI suite, driven from Rust |
| Python training | Rust engine | files | `formats/safetensors.md`, `formats/config.schema.json`, `formats/tokenizer.md` (including the `bytes` tokenizer, D32) | `formats/` |
| Python corpus | Python training | files | `formats/corpus-shard.md`, `formats/tokens-bin.md`, `formats/ledger.schema.json` | `formats/` |
| Python sampler | Rust sampler | spec | `spec/pcg32.md`, `spec/sampling.md` | `parity/rng`, `parity/sampler` (golden ids from shared fixture logits) |
| any client | engine | HTTP | `openapi/openai-subset.v1.yaml` (engine tier) | `openapi/` (`ss conform openapi:v1 --target engine`) |
| any client | gateway | HTTP | `openapi/openai-subset.v1.yaml`, `openapi/admin.v1.yaml` | `openapi/` (`--target gateway`), `admin/` |
| gateway | engine (control) | gRPC | `proto/tl/engine/v1/engine.proto` | `engine-grpc/` |
| engine prefill | engine decode | gRPC | `proto/tl/kv/v1/kv.proto` + `formats/kv-block.md` | `kv/`, `parity/kv.wire.v1` |
| gateway | engine decode (abort path) | gRPC `KvTransferService.Release` | `proto/tl/kv/v1/kv.proto` | `kv/` (release frees the handle's blocks) |
| gateway policy | engine | HTTP `/v1/embeddings` + a linear head file (D33) | `openapi/openai-subset.v1.yaml`, `formats/linear-head.schema.json` | `formats/`, `openapi/` `policy.451` |
| engine | gateway registry | gRPC | `proto/tl/control/v1/control.proto` | `engine-grpc/` |
| worker, CLI | durable | gRPC | `proto/tl/durable/v1/durable.proto` | `durable/` (incl. replay determinism) |
| durable | durable | gRPC | `proto/tl/raft/v1/raft.proto` | `raft/` (partition script, linearizability check) |
| Go worker | Python | subprocess + files | `spec/subprocess-activity.md` | `activity/` |
| all services | collector | OTLP gRPC `:4317`; OTLP/HTTP JSON `:4318` for the std-only tracer engine | `otel/semconv.md`, `otel/metrics.yaml` | `otel/` (span tree from a recorded trace) |
| all services | config | TOML + env | `config/runtime.schema.json` | `config/` |
| harness | learner | TOML | `config/system.schema.json` | `ss` validates `system.toml` on every milestone |

### 2.4 C ABI: `tinyllm.h`

`c/include/tinyllm.h` is an umbrella header. Each unit has its own header under `c/include/tinyllm/`, which is what makes per-file ownership (D15) possible. `c/ABI.md` holds the rules:

- The caller owns every buffer. No function allocates except `*_create`, and those allocate through the allocator hook.
- No callbacks across the boundary except `tl_parallel_for`'s range function, which stays inside C.
- Shapes and strides are `int64_t`. Matrices are row-major with explicit leading dimensions.
- Every public struct's layout is asserted by `conformance/abi/layout_test.py` with `ctypes.sizeof` and `ctypes.offsetof`.
- `nm` on `libtinyllm` exports only `tl_` symbols. The check normalizes names first (Mach-O prefixes a leading `_`).
- **Enums never cross the boundary as C enum types.** `tl_status` and `tl_dtype` are `typedef int32_t` with named constants, and struct fields that carry them are `int32_t`, because a Rust `repr(C)` enum holding an unknown value is undefined behavior. Rust and Python map unknown values to an error.
- **Thread safety.** Kernels are reentrant. Stateful objects (`tl_arena`, `tl_kv_pool`, `tl_map`, `tl_lru`) are **not thread-safe**: the caller serializes access (the Rust engine owns the pool behind one `Mutex` used by the step loop and the KV-transfer tasks). `tl_last_error` is `_Thread_local`.
- Threads use **pthreads** only (`<threads.h>` is missing on macOS).
- **Batch invariance** (L9.1, L9.3, L9.4): each output element's reduction over K (or over keys) uses one fixed order, independent of M, of the row's position in the batch, and of the query tile; key tiles are aligned to absolute key positions. Row `i` of a product computed with `M = 1` equals row `i` computed with `M = 37` bitwise. This is what makes batched and chunked greedy output equal the serial output.
- Bindings resolve symbols **lazily**, on first use (the `rt.01` loader contract), and the harness always links a stub object (every function returns `TL_EUNSUPPORTED` or the type's zero value with `tl_last_error` set) for units not yet started, so a partial library always loads.
- Bumping `TL_ABI_VERSION`'s major part is a migration (`craft.13` style); Python and Rust bindings refuse a mismatched major.

### 2.5 Python to Rust: `tinyllm_rs`

```python
# contracts/py/tinyllm_rs.pyi  (built by `cargo build -p tl-py`; maturin optional)
class Bpe:
    @staticmethod
    def from_hf_json(path: str) -> "Bpe": ...
    def encode(self, text: str) -> list[int]: ...
    def encode_batch(self, texts: list[str], threads: int) -> list[list[int]]: ...   # releases the GIL
    def decode(self, ids: list[int]) -> str: ...

```

Build contract for `tl-py` (checked by the contract pre-check): `crate-type = ["cdylib"]`, PyO3 features `abi3-py311` and `extension-module`, and on macOS the link argument `-undefined dynamic_lookup` (in `.cargo/config.toml` or `build.rs`). The harness sets `PYO3_PYTHON` to the interpreter of the learner's uv environment and copies `libtl_py.dylib` to `tinyllm_rs.so` in `TINYLLM_PYEXT_DIR`.

### 2.6 HTTP surface (OpenAPI)

Files: `openapi/openai-subset.v0.yaml` (tracer), `openai-subset.v1.yaml`, `openai-subset.v2.yaml` (migration drill), `admin.v1.yaml`. Two tiers share one spec: the **engine tier** (no auth, plus extensions) and the **gateway tier** (auth, limits, headers).

| Version | Introduced | Surface |
|---|---|---|
| v0 | `L10.0` (tracer) | `POST /v1/completions` `{model, prompt, max_tokens, temperature, seed, stream}`, SSE `data: {...}\n\n` ending `data: [DONE]\n\n`, `GET /healthz` |
| v1 | `L10.5`, `gw.04` | full table below |
| v2 | `ops.05` drill, `craft.14` | `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`; `/v1/completions` deprecated with `Deprecation` and `Sunset` headers; new error `code` values. v1 and v2 served side by side during the window |

**Public endpoints (v1)**:

| Method, path | Request fields | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | `model, messages[{role,content,tool_calls,tool_call_id}], max_tokens, max_completion_tokens, temperature, top_p, top_k`(ext), `min_p`(ext), `repetition_penalty`(ext), `presence_penalty, frequency_penalty, seed, stop, stream, stream_options.include_usage, logprobs, top_logprobs, tools, tool_choice, response_format{type:json_object}, user` | `chat.completion` or SSE `chat.completion.chunk` | `n` must be 1, else 422; `tools`, `tool_choice`, and `response_format` are served from `L10.9` (422 `unsupported_parameter` before it) |
| `POST /v1/completions` | `model, prompt (string), max_tokens, temperature, top_p, top_k, seed, stop, stream, echo=false, logprobs (0..5)` | `text_completion` or SSE | deprecated in v2 |
| `POST /v1/embeddings` | `model, input (string or array), encoding_format=float` | `list` of `embedding` | mean-pooled final hidden states, L2-normalized |
| `GET /v1/models`, `GET /v1/models/{id}` | | `list` of `model{id, object, created, owned_by}` | from the route table (gateway) or the loaded model (engine) |
| `POST /v1/tokenize` | `model, text, add_special` | `{ids}` | engine tier only; the gateway uses it for TPM cost |
| `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz`, `GET /metrics` | | | health port on every service: `:9464` in k8s, `{health_port}` when the milestone runner starts services locally (2.16) |

**SSE framing** (tested byte for byte): one `data: <json>\n\n` per chunk. The first chunk carries `delta.role`. The last content chunk carries `finish_reason` in `{stop, length, tool_calls, content_filter}`. An optional usage chunk has `choices: []`. Then `data: [DONE]\n\n`. A comment `: ping\n\n` is sent every 15 s while idle. On client disconnect the engine request is aborted within one decode step and its KV blocks return to the pool. A failure after the first byte emits an SSE error event, never a silent truncation, and is never retried or spliced.

**Errors** always use `{"error":{"message","type","param","code"}}`:

| Status | `type` / `code` | When |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid_request_error` | malformed JSON, out-of-range parameter (for example `temperature=-1`) |
| 401 | `invalid_request_error` / `invalid_api_key` | missing or unknown key |
| 403 | `permission_error` / `insufficient_scope` | key lacks the scope or model |
| 404 | `invalid_request_error` / `model_not_found` | unknown model |
| 422 | `invalid_request_error` / `unsupported_parameter` | for example `n > 1` |
| 429 | `rate_limit_error` / `rate_limit_exceeded` | sets `Retry-After`; also engine admission queue full |
| 451 | `policy_error` / `usage_policy` | usage policy block (also `finish_reason: content_filter` mid-stream) |
| 503 | `server_error` / `no_capacity` | no healthy worker, or all KV pools full past the queue deadline |

**Headers.** In: `Authorization: Bearer tl_<id>_<secret>`, `traceparent`, optional `X-Request-Id`. Out: `X-Request-Id`, `x-ratelimit-limit-requests`, `x-ratelimit-remaining-requests`, `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens`, `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens`, `x-ratelimit-reset-tokens`, `X-TL-Cache: hit|miss`, `X-TL-Route` (debug scope only). Internal only, stripped by the gateway from client requests and set by it toward engines: `X-TL-KV-Handle` (disaggregated resume, 2.7) and `X-TL-Priority` (integer, from the key's tenant tier; read by the `L10.2` scheduler; conformance case `priority.internal`).

**Admin** (`/admin/v1`, scope `admin`):

| Method, path | Body / query | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /admin/v1/keys` | `{tenant, name, scopes:["infer","embed","admin","debug"], rpm, tpm, models, expires_at}` | returns the plaintext key once; only the HMAC is stored |

### 2.7 gRPC services (`proto/tl/*/v1/*.proto`)

Generated code is part of the contract: `contracts/go/gen/` (protoc-gen-go and protoc-gen-go-grpc output, package path `supersource.urmzd.com/tl/contracts/gen/...`) and the `contracts/rust/tl-proto` crate (prost and tonic output committed, no `build.rs`). The learner implements the services against these stubs and never runs `protoc`; `lang.10` shows how the stubs are produced. Every message is capped at 4 MiB.

**`tl/engine/v1/engine.proto`**: internal engine control, served by every engine on `:50051` (`{grpc_port}` locally).

```proto
syntax = "proto3";
package tl.engine.v1;
service EngineControl {
  rpc Prefill(PrefillRequest) returns (PrefillResponse);   // prefill role: run prefill, push KV to decode_target
  rpc Info(InfoRequest)       returns (InfoResponse);      // model id, roles, kv format, max ctx, abi
  rpc Cancel(CancelRequest)   returns (CancelResponse);
  rpc Drain(DrainRequest)     returns (DrainResponse);
}
message SamplingParams { float temperature = 1; float top_p = 2; int32 top_k = 3; float min_p = 4;
  float repetition_penalty = 5; float presence_penalty = 6; float frequency_penalty = 7;
  uint64 seed = 8; int32 max_new_tokens = 9; repeated string stop = 10; int32 logprobs = 11; }
message PrefillRequest { string request_id = 1; string model = 2; repeated uint32 prompt_ids = 3;
  SamplingParams sampling = 4; string decode_target = 5;   // host:port of the decode worker's KvTransferService
  int64 deadline_unix_ms = 6; int32 priority = 7; }        // priority mirrors X-TL-Priority
message PrefillResponse { KvHandle handle = 1; uint32 first_token = 2; float first_logprob = 3;
  int32 prompt_tokens = 4; int32 cached_prompt_tokens = 5; double ttft_ms = 6; }
message KvHandle { string handle_id = 1; string decode_target = 2;
  uint32 n_tokens = 3;                 // == prompt_tokens: the transferred KV covers the prompt only
  repeated uint64 block_hashes = 4;    // full blocks only; the partial tail block is sent unhashed
  uint32 kv_format = 5;
  uint32 first_token = 6;              // sampled by P; D feeds it as its first decode input
  uint32 prompt_tokens = 7;
  uint32 rng_draws_consumed = 8; }     // uniform_f64 draws P used (1 when sampled, 0 when greedy); D advances its PCG32 by this many
message InfoRequest {}
message InfoResponse { string model = 1; repeated string roles = 2; uint32 kv_format = 3;
  int32 max_context = 4; int32 block_size = 5; uint32 abi = 6; }
message CancelRequest { string request_id = 1; }   message CancelResponse { bool found = 1; }
message DrainRequest { int64 deadline_ms = 1; }    message DrainResponse {}
```

**Disaggregated flow.** The gateway picks a prefill worker P and a decode worker D. It calls `P.Prefill(decode_target = D.kv_address)`. P runs prefill over the prompt, samples the first token from the last prompt position with the request's seeded PCG32, asks D `HasBlocks` for the prompt's full-block hashes, streams only the missing blocks (plus the unhashed partial tail block) with `PushKv`, and returns a `KvHandle` carrying `first_token`, `prompt_tokens`, and `rng_draws_consumed`. The gateway emits the first token to the client, then POSTs the request to D's `/v1/chat/completions` with `stream: true` and `X-TL-KV-Handle: <handle_id>`. D seeds its PCG32 from the same request seed, advances it by `rng_draws_consumed`, appends `first_token` as its first decode input (its KV is computed by D's first step), and continues. So a seeded disaggregated stream equals the unified stream given equal logits. On abort the gateway calls `Release` on D.

**`tl/kv/v1/kv.proto`**: served by decode workers on `:50052` (`{kv_port}` locally).

```proto
syntax = "proto3";
package tl.kv.v1;
service KvTransferService {
  rpc HasBlocks(HasBlocksRequest) returns (HasBlocksResponse);   // dedup by content hash
  rpc PushKv(stream KvChunk) returns (KvAck);
  rpc Release(ReleaseRequest) returns (ReleaseResponse);         // gateway abort path
}
message HasBlocksRequest  { repeated uint64 block_hashes = 1; uint32 kv_format = 2; }
message HasBlocksResponse { repeated bool present = 1; }
message KvChunk { string handle_id = 1; uint64 block_hash = 2; uint32 block_index = 3;
  uint32 n_blocks_total = 4; uint32 kv_format = 5;   // mismatch: FAILED_PRECONDITION
  bytes payload = 6;                                   // one block in the formats/kv-block.md export envelope, <= 4 MiB per chunk
  uint32 crc32c = 7; }
message KvAck { string handle_id = 1; uint32 blocks_received = 2; uint32 blocks_deduped = 3; }
message ReleaseRequest { string handle_id = 1; }   message ReleaseResponse {}
```

**`tl/control/v1/control.proto`**: worker registry, served by the gateway on `:50060` (`{registry_port}` locally). The engine's heartbeat client is owned by `L10.6`; the gateway runs one replica on kind (2.13), so one registry sees every heartbeat.

```proto
syntax = "proto3";
package tl.control.v1;
service WorkerRegistry { rpc Heartbeat(WorkerStatus) returns (HeartbeatAck); }  // every 2 s; 3 misses = evicted
message WorkerStatus { string worker_id = 1; string http_address = 2; string grpc_address = 3;
  string kv_address = 4; string role = 5;   // unified | prefill | decode
  string model = 6; uint32 kv_format = 7; int32 queue_depth = 8; int32 running = 9;
  int32 kv_free_blocks = 10; int32 kv_total_blocks = 11; bool draining = 12; }
message HeartbeatAck { bool drain = 1; uint64 route_epoch = 2; }
```

**`tl/durable/v1/durable.proto`**: served by the durable server on `:7233` (`{grpc_port}` locally; NodePort 30733 on kind for a host-side training worker, 2.13). Both the CLI and workers use it.

```proto
syntax = "proto3";
package tl.durable.v1;
service WorkflowService {                                               // owners in brackets

  rpc ListDeadLetters(ListDeadLettersRequest) returns (ListDeadLettersResponse);      // [dur.03]
  rpc RedriveDeadLetter(RedriveDeadLetterRequest) returns (RedriveDeadLetterResponse); // [dur.03]

```

**Payload limits** (enforced by the server, tested in dur.06): activity input and result at most 2 MiB each (larger data goes to `/artifacts` and travels by path); a workflow whose history passes 10,000 events or 32 MiB is told to `ContinueAsNew` (owned by dur.06), which `AgentRun` and long `TrainRun`s do at a checkpoint boundary. The durable server also serves the test-only `POST /debug/clock {"offset_ms": N}` on its health port, enabled only by `--test-clock` and owned by dur.07; the `clock-skew` drill injector uses it.

The Go SDK surface the tests import (`go/durable/workflow`, `go/durable/activity`, `go/durable/worker`):

```go
type Workflow func(ctx workflow.Context, input []byte) ([]byte, error)
func ExecuteActivity[O any](ctx workflow.Context, name string, in any, o ActivityOptions) workflow.Future[O]
func Sleep(ctx workflow.Context, d time.Duration) error          // durable timer
func Now(ctx workflow.Context) time.Time                          // from history, never the wall clock
func SideEffect[T any](ctx workflow.Context, f func() T) T        // MarkerRecorded
func GetVersion(ctx workflow.Context, changeID string, min, max int) int
func GetSignalChannel(ctx workflow.Context, name string) workflow.ReceiveChannel
func ContinueAsNew(ctx workflow.Context, input []byte) error      // ends this run; a new run_id starts with input
func activity.IdempotencyKey(ctx context.Context) string          // "<workflow_id>/<activity_id>"
func activity.RecordHeartbeat(ctx context.Context, details []byte)
type Worker interface { RegisterWorkflow(name string, wf Workflow); RegisterActivity(name string, fn any); Run(ctx context.Context) error }
var ErrNondeterminism = errors.New("durable: command does not match history")
```

Workflows are Go only. Python implements activities only, through the subprocess contract, which keeps determinism in one language.

**`tl/raft/v1/raft.proto`**: `RequestVote`, `AppendEntries`, `InstallSnapshot` as in the Raft paper's figure 2, on `:7234`. Each entry is one WAL record (2.9), so Raft replicates exactly the bytes the single-node server writes.

### 2.8 Subprocess activity contract (`spec/subprocess-activity.md`)

| Item | Contract |
|---|---|
| Invocation | `{tinyllm} <verb> --spec <dir>/spec.json --progress <dir>/progress.jsonl` or `{corpus} <verb> ...` (verbs: `train`, `eval`, `export`, `run --stage <s>`, `tokenize`). Spec files validate against `formats/train-spec.schema.json`, `formats/eval-spec.schema.json`, or `formats/corpus-config.schema.json`; a spec that fails validation exits `65` |
| Env | `TRACEPARENT`, `TL_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY`, `TL_ARTIFACTS=/artifacts`, `TL_ATTEMPT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` |
| Progress | one JSON line per event: `{"ts":..., "kind":"step|ckpt|metric|done", "step":int, "loss":float, "lr":float, "tokens":int, "ckpt":"runs/<run_id>/ckpt/step-000500"}` |
| Heartbeat | the Go runner tails `progress.jsonl` and calls `RecordHeartbeat` with the last `ckpt` path as details. On retry it passes `--resume <ckpt>` |
| Exit codes | `0` success, `75` (EX_TEMPFAIL) retryable, `65` (EX_DATAERR) non-retryable, `130` cancelled, anything else retryable |
| Idempotency | outputs go under a directory named by `TL_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY`; completion is an atomic `rename` of `*.tmp`, so a rerun after success is a no-op |
| Cancellation | SIGTERM; Python checkpoints and exits `130` within 30 s |

The Go side is `go/activities/subprocess.go` and the Python side is `python/tinyllm/io/activity.py` (progress writer, signal handler, atomic output) plus `python/tinyllm/io/telemetry.py` (OTLP export from `TRACEPARENT`). All belong to `dur.09`.

### 2.9 File formats (`formats/`)

| Artifact | Path under `/artifacts` | Format |
|---|---|---|
| Raw docs | `corpus/raw/<source_id>/<yyyymmdd>/*.jsonl.zst` | `{url, fetched_at, license_spdx, text}` |
| Corpus config | `specs/corpus/<dataset>.toml` (fixture `corpus/small.toml`) | `formats/corpus-config.schema.json`: sources (url, sha256, license), filter thresholds, dedup parameters, protected eval sets for decontamination, shard size, tokenizer id |
| Train and eval specs | `specs/<name>.json` | `formats/train-spec.schema.json` (model config, data paths, optimizer, schedule, precision, steps, eval cadence, seed) and `formats/eval-spec.schema.json` (suite ids, model ids, judge, A/B pairing) |
| Eval suite input | `evals/suites/<suite>.jsonl` | `formats/eval-case.schema.json`: `{case_id, input, ground_truth?, tags[], scorer_args{}}` |
| Usage policy | `gateway/policy.v1.yaml` | `formats/policy.v1.schema.json`: rules `{id, match{model?, tenant?, max_tokens?}, classifier{head, threshold}?, action: allow\|deny, reason}`; first match wins |
| Linear head | `models/<id>/heads/<name>.json` | `formats/linear-head.schema.json`: `{embedding_model, dim, classes[], W[classes][dim], b[classes], threshold}` (D33) |
| Clean shards | `corpus/<dataset>/<version>/shard-00000-of-00064.parquet` | Parquet, zstd, 64 MiB row groups. Schema: `id string, text string, source_id string, url string, license_spdx string, lang string, n_chars int32, sha256 fixed_size_binary(32), minhash_cluster int64, pii_redactions int32, split string` |
| Shard manifest | `corpus/<dataset>/<version>/_MANIFEST.json` | `{dataset, version, n_docs, n_shards, shards:[{name, sha256, rows}], dedup:{exact_dropped, near_dropped, jaccard_threshold:0.8, num_perm:128, bands:16}, pii:{emails, phones, cards, ips, keys}, ledger_ref, config_sha256}` |
| Data ledger | `corpus/LEDGER.jsonl` (schema `formats/ledger.schema.json`) | `{source_id, url, license_spdx, retrieved_at, sha256, n_docs, allowed_uses:["train","eval"], pii_policy, filters_applied, kept, dropped, notes}`. `ModelRelease` refuses a model whose sources are not licensed for `train` |
| Token streams | `tokens/<tokenizer_id>/<dataset>/train-00000.bin`, `val-00000.bin` | llm.c layout: 256 x int32 header (`[0]=20240520` magic, `[1]` version, `[2]` n_tokens, `[3]` vocab_size), then `uint16` tokens (`uint32` when version is 2). Split by document hash, so no document crosses train and val |
| Tokenizer | `tokenizer.json` | HF `tokenizers` JSON subset: `model.type` in `{BPE, WordPiece, Unigram}`, `pre_tokenizer.type = ByteLevel` (GPT-2 split), `added_tokens`, `post_processor` limited to `TemplateProcessing`. SmolLM2's file must load unchanged. A char tokenizer (L1.1) saves as `tinyllm_char.json` (`{"type":"char","vocab":[...],"specials":{...}}`). **No file** plus `config.json` `tl_tokenizer = "bytes"` means the identity byte tokenizer: 256 ids, id = UTF-8 byte (D32) |
| Model weights | `model.safetensors` | u64 LE header length, JSON header, raw little-endian data. `formats/safetensors.md` writes down the canonical tensor ordering and header padding of the `safetensors` version pinned in the oracle, so a writer can be byte-identical to it. Dtypes `F32, F16, BF16, F8_E4M3, U8, I8, I32`. Llama/HF tensor names (`model.embed_tokens.weight`, `model.layers.{i}.self_attn.{q,k,v,o}_proj.weight`, `model.layers.{i}.mlp.{gate,up,down}_proj.weight`, `model.layers.{i}.{input,post_attention}_layernorm.weight`, `model.norm.weight`, optional `lm_head.weight`). Int4: `<name>.qweight` U8 `[out, in/2]` low nibble = even column, `<name>.scales` F16 `[out, in/group]`, `__metadata__ = {"format":"tinyllm","quant":"int4-g<group>-sym"}` |
| Model config | `config.json` | HF `LlamaConfig` keys plus `tl_*` extensions: `tl_arch` in `{bigram, nplm, word2vec, rnnlm, seq2seq, transformer, gpt, bert, electra, llama}` (optional modules add `elmo`, `t5`; every value loads through `L6.7`'s zoo dispatch, and the Rust engine serves `bigram` and `llama`), `tl_tokenizer` in `{bytes, file}`, `tl_cell` in `{rnn, lstm, gru}`, `tl_attention` in `{mha, gqa, mqa, mla}`, `tl_mla_rank`, `tl_sliding_window`, `tl_sink_tokens`, `tl_num_experts`, `tl_top_k_experts`, `tl_pos` in `{rope, yarn, alibi, learned, sinusoidal}`, `tl_format` (checkpoint format version) |
| Generation config | `generation_config.json` | `{bos_token_id, eos_token_id, chat_template}` (Jinja subset: `for`, `if`, `loop.last`, `message.role/content`) |
| Checkpoint | `runs/<run_id>/ckpt/step-000500/` | `model.safetensors`, `optimizer.safetensors` (`<param>.exp_avg`, `<param>.exp_avg_sq`), `config.json`, `tokenizer.json`, `trainer_state.json` (`{step, tokens_seen, data_cursor:{shard, offset}, rng:{pcg_state, pcg_inc}, lr, config_sha256, git_sha}`), `MANIFEST.json` (sha256 per file). `runs/<run_id>/ckpt/LATEST` names the step dir and is swapped by atomic rename |
| Released model | `models/<model_id>/<version>/` | weights, configs, tokenizer, `MODEL_CARD.md`, `ledger.json`, `evals/summary.json`, `MANIFEST.json` |
| Eval results | `evals/<suite>/<run_id>/results.jsonl`, `summary.json` | row `{suite, case_id, subject, input_sha, output, scores:{name:float}, latency_ms, ttft_ms, tokens, trace_id}`; summary holds means with 95% bootstrap CIs and, for A/B, delta, CI, and paired-test p-value |
| RAG index | `rag/<index_id>/` | `docs.jsonl`, `bm25.idx` (term dictionary + varint postings), `vectors.f32` (row-major, `dim` in `meta.json`), `meta.json` |
| KV block | `formats/kv-block.md` | The in-memory layout is private to `rt.04`. The **export envelope** (used by `tl_kv_export`/`tl_kv_import` and every `PushKv` payload) is the same for all versions: header `{magic "TLKV", u16 version, u16 dtype, u32 n_blocks, u32 block_tokens, u32 n_layers, u32 n_kv_heads, u32 head_dim}`, then per block `{u64 block_hash (0 for the partial tail block), u32 n_tokens, payload}`, then `u32 crc32c` over everything before it. **v1 payload**: f16 `[n_layers][2][n_kv_heads][block_tokens][head_dim]`. **v2 payload** (`craft.13`): fp8 e4m3 in the same order, then per-(layer, head) f32 scales. `block_hash = fnv1a64(parent_hash_le8 ‖ token_ids_le_u32[block_tokens])`, parent of block 0 is `0`; only full blocks are hashed, registered, or deduplicated |
| Durable WAL | `wal/00000000000000000000.log` on its own PVC | record `u32 len ‖ u32 crc32c ‖ u64 seq ‖ payload` (proto `WalRecord{workflow_id, HistoryEvent}`); 64 MiB segments; a torn tail is truncated on recovery. Total size is capped by `durable.wal_max_bytes`: at the cap, appends fail with gRPC `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` and no acked record is touched; raising the cap resumes writes |
| Usage ledger | `gateway/usage.db` (schema `formats/usage.v1.sql`) | one row per request: tenant, key id, model, prompt/completion/cached tokens, ttft, status, api version, trace id |
| Loadgen report | `bench/<run_id>/report.json` | `{rate_rps, duration_s, ttft_ms:{p50,p90,p99}, tpot_ms:{...}, itl_ms:{...}, e2e_ms:{...}, error_rate, goodput, tokens_per_s, histogram}` |

### 2.10 Determinism specs (`spec/`)

| Spec | Content |
|---|---|
| `pcg32.md` | PCG-XSH-RR 64/32 as in O'Neill's reference `pcg32_srandom_r(initstate, initseq)`. `uniform_f64 = ((a >> 5) * 2^26 + (b >> 6)) * 2^-53` from two consecutive draws `a, b`. Normals by Box-Muller from two consecutive `uniform_f64` values `u1, u2` (`u1` mapped to `1 - u1` so `log` never sees 0), both outputs used in order. Sub-streams per purpose (`init`, `dropout`, `shuffle`, `sample`, `mutation`) derive their seed with SplitMix64 over `(seed, purpose_id)`. Reference vectors: the first 1024 outputs for seeds `0, 1, 2^63` |
| `sampling.md` | Logits f32 to f64; repetition, presence, frequency penalties; divide by temperature; top-k; top-p over a stable sort by (logit desc, id asc), keeping the token that crosses `p`; min-p; softmax; exactly one `uniform_f64` per sampled token; inverse CDF. `temperature == 0` is greedy with ties to the lowest id. Given **the same logits and seed**, Python `tinyllm.infer.sample` and Rust `tl-engine` emit identical ids (`parity/sampler`, on fixture logits). End-to-end streams from different float paths are compared greedily under the near-tie rule (5.7), never seeded |
| `subprocess-activity.md` | 2.8 |
| `cli-roles.md` | the entry roles a learner declares in `system.toml` (2.16) and the verbs each milestone calls. Fixed rules: `{tinyllm} generate` prints the generated ids as a final JSON line `{"ids": [...], "text": ..., ...}` so matchers need no tokenizer; the tracer `engine` role takes `--model-dir --port` (`--config` from `L10.5`); `{worker} --test-activities` registers the course test activity `tl.test.Append` (appends its idempotency key to the `effects` sink) and the course test workflows used by replay and kill-loop tests; `{durable} --test-clock` enables `/debug/clock` |

### 2.11 Observability conventions (`otel/`)

Propagation is W3C `traceparent` over HTTP and gRPC metadata. In Pass 1 the std-only tracer engine parses `traceparent` and exports its spans by hand as OTLP/HTTP JSON (`POST /v1/traces` to the collector or Jaeger on `:4318`); `L10.7` replaces that with `tracing-opentelemetry`. The durable engine stores the starter's context in `WorkflowExecutionStarted.trace_context` and hands it to every activity (`ActivityTask.trace_context`); Python receives it as `TRACEPARENT`. One `TrainRun` is one trace, from the CLI to every sampled Python step.

Prometheus names come from the collector's OTel translation (for example `gen_ai_server_time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket`). Every service also serves the same instruments on `:9464/metrics` (`{health_port}` locally) so tests can scrape without a collector. Logs are JSON with `trace_id` and `span_id`. There is no log backend: log-to-trace correlation is `kubectl logs` plus a `trace_id` grep (obs.02); Loki is "Going further".

**SLOs** (`deploy/observability/slo.yaml`, learner-written, schema in `otel/slo.schema.json`):

| SLO | Course default | Alerting |
|---|---|---|
| TTFT p95 | < 500 ms at 4 rps (unified engine, SmolLM2-135M int4, reference Mac) | multi-window burn rate: 1h/5m at 14.4x, 6h/30m at 6x |
| TPOT p95 | < 60 ms | same |
| Availability | 99.5% (5xx ratio < 0.5% over 30 days) | same |

Latency defaults are scaled by `ss bench --calibrate` (5.11); SLOs checked on kind use the in-cluster calibration Job, not the host. The learner may declare stricter targets, never looser ones. `otel/slo.schema.json` fixes the required alert names (`TTFTBudgetBurnFast`, `TTFTBudgetBurnSlow`, `TPOTBudgetBurnFast`, `TPOTBudgetBurnSlow`, `AvailabilityBudgetBurnFast`, `AvailabilityBudgetBurnSlow`) and two window profiles: `prod` (1h/5m and 6h/30m) and `drill` (the same ratios compressed 12x: 5m/25s and 30m/2.5m), so a drill can fire a burn alert within minutes.

### 2.12 Runtime configuration (`config/runtime.schema.json`)

One TOML file, `runtime.toml`, mounted as a ConfigMap. Every **scalar** key can be overridden by `TL_<SECTION>__<KEY>` (double underscore between section and key, both upper-cased; for example `TL_ENGINE__KV_BLOCKS=4096`); arrays and tables are not overridable. Allowed parsers: Python `tomllib`, Rust `toml`, Go `github.com/BurntSushi/toml`. The Go loader is `go/config` (owned by `gw.01`); conformance cases in `config/` cover precedence and the separator. When the milestone runner starts services locally, it generates one `runtime.toml` per service from the learner's `[services.*].config` template with the allocated ports filled in (2.16).

### 2.13 Ports and Kubernetes objects

| Component | Helm chart | Kind | Replicas on kind | Ports |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| gateway | `<system>-gateway` (dep.00, dep.03) | Deployment + Service (NodePort 30080), PDB `maxUnavailable: 1` | **1** (rate-limit buckets, the response cache, the SQLite ledger, and the worker registry are per process; scaling out is "Going further") | 8080 http, 9464 health/metrics, 50060 registry |
| engine | `<system>-engine` (value `role`; dep.00, dep.03) | Deployment per role | unified 1, or prefill 1 + decode 2 | 8000 http, 50051 control, 50052 kv, 9464 |
| durable | `<system>-durable` (dep.06) | StatefulSet + PVC + Service (NodePort 30733 for a host-side worker) | 1 (3 with Raft) | 7233 grpc, 7234 raft, 9464 |
| worker | `<system>-worker` (dep.06) | Deployment (image has the Go worker and the Python env); KEDA `ScaledObject` on `tl.durable.task_queue.depth` | 2 | 9464 |
| agent | `<system>-agent` (dep.07) | Deployment running the agent worker (`AgentRun` workflows and tools on queue `agent`); frontier key, if any, from a `Secret` | 1 | 9464 |
| observability | upstream charts pinned in `deploy/observability/Chart.lock` | Pass 1: Jaeger all-in-one (OTLP in, query NodePort 30686). From Pass 7: otel-collector, kube-prometheus-stack, Tempo; KEDA from Pass 8 | 1 | 4317, 4318, 9090 (NodePort 30090), 3000 (NodePort 30300), Tempo query 3200 (NodePort 30320) |

All pods mount the hostPath `/artifacts`, backed by the kind node's `extraMounts` of `./artifacts`. That is a single-node simplification; the chapter's "Going further" covers object stores and RWX volumes. kind reaches NodePorts from the host only through `extraPortMappings`, so the cluster config maps 30080 and 30686 from Pass 1 (dep.00) and adds 30090, 30300, 30320, and 30733 in Pass 7 (dep.02 recreates the cluster). Chart policy (checked by `dep.03`, `dep.06`, `dep.07`): probes, resource limits, non-root, no `:latest`, PDB present, secrets only through `Secret` references (the values schema rejects literal secret values), `values.schema.json` from `contracts/helm/`. `contracts/helm/observability.md` pins the upstream chart versions and the `PrometheusRule` label selector that kube-prometheus-stack must match.

**Training on a Mac.** Training inside the kind VM gets Linux OpenBLAS and competes with the cluster for Docker's memory. The learner may run `{worker} --queue train` on the host, connected to the durable NodePort 30733; the trace and the workflow are unchanged. `ss doctor` reports Docker's CPU and memory allocation and fails below 6 CPUs and 12 GiB for Pass 7 onward.

### 2.15 The learner's repo

`ss course init --name <system>` creates it (default `.scratchpad/course/`, which supersource already gitignores; `SS_COURSE_HOME` points every command at an external repo). It writes only `system.toml`, `.gitignore`, and `contracts/`, then runs `git init`. Library manifests (`Cargo.toml` lib targets, `go.mod` with the `replace` for the contracts module, `pyproject.toml`) are written by `ss start` **only if absent** and are never rewritten afterwards, by `ss start`, `ss reset`, or anything else: the learner adds binaries and dependencies to them. The contract pre-check (5.4) verifies the required entries instead (lib targets, crate names, the contracts `replace`, the `tl-py` build contract). Binaries, servers, and deploy files are never written. Entry points are marked `(learner)` below.

**Glue files** (crate roots like `tl-py/src/lib.rs`, Python `__main__`) belong to the first module that creates them. A crate root declares every submodule the contract lists; `ss start` writes stubs for submodules not yet started, so the crate always compiles. A stub keeps every contract signature and replaces only function bodies (5.2), and `ss start` never overwrites an existing learner file.

**Cross-file seams.** Files of one crate or package reach each other only through names the contract declares (including crate-internal seams such as `tl_engine::sched::Scheduler` or `corpus.stage.Stage`). That is what lets a reference file sit next to learner files in the overlay; `ss verify course` enforces it with an AST lint over the references and by compiling each reference unit against stubbed neighbours.

Milestone commands in this document are written with role placeholders: `{tinyllm} generate ...` means "the learner's `tinyllm` entry, then `generate ...`", and `{ctl} train ...` is the umbrella CLI. Missing entries fail with `milestone MS-L8 needs [entry].tinyllm in system.toml`. **Ports are never fixed locally**: the runner allocates `{port}`, `{health_port}`, `{grpc_port}`, `{kv_port}`, and `{registry_port}` per service instance, writes them into that instance's generated `runtime.toml` (`{config}`) and into `TL_*__*` overrides, and exposes them to other entries as `{<service>.<port>}`. A milestone that starts a gateway plus a prefill and two decode engines on one host therefore gets distinct ports. Fixed ports (2.13) apply only inside k8s.

### 2.17 End-to-end data flow

Everything runs on one kind cluster. Every hop carries `traceparent`, and every long-running step is a durable workflow, so a pod kill at any point resumes rather than restarts.

1. **Ingest.** `<system> data build --dataset tinystories --version v1` calls `StartWorkflow(CorpusBuild, workflow_id="corpus/tinystories/v1")`. The id is idempotent, so a second call returns the same run. The server appends `WorkflowExecutionStarted` to the WAL and enqueues a workflow task on `data`.
2. **Corpus activities.** A worker replays the history and schedules `fetch`, `filter`, `dedup_exact`, `dedup_near`, `pii`, `shard`, and `tokenize`, each as `{corpus} run --stage <s>` under the subprocess contract. Fetch appends to `LEDGER.jsonl`. Exact dedup screens with the Bloom filter and confirms with SHA-256; near dedup uses MinHash LSH and union-find, then drops documents that share a 13-gram with any protected eval or validation set (decontamination). PII scrub counts redactions. Shard writes parquet plus `_MANIFEST.json`. Tokenize writes llm.c `.bin` files using the learner's Rust tokenizer. A poisoned shard exhausts its retries and lands in the DLQ (`ListDeadLetters`), which is what `ops.03` drills.
3. **Train.** `<system> train --spec specs/tinystories-10m.json` starts `TrainRun`. The `train` activity execs `{tinyllm} train`, which memory-maps the token files, runs the learner's autograd, AdamW, and schedule, and writes atomic checkpoints. The worker tails `progress.jsonl` and heartbeats with the latest checkpoint. If the worker pod dies, the visibility timeout expires, another worker picks up the task with `attempt=2`, and it resumes from `LATEST`. A durable timer spaces periodic `eval` activities.
4. **Release.** `ModelRelease` (dur.12) exports the checkpoint to `models/<id>/<ver>/` (optionally int4), runs `EvalSuite` (dur.11: quality, the model-zoo regression table, bias, safety), and gates on eval thresholds, `MODEL_CARD.md`, and ledger licenses that allow `train`. It waits on the signal `approve`, then calls `PUT /admin/v1/routes` with a canary weight, waits 10 minutes on a durable timer, checks the SLO burn rate through a Prometheus query activity, and promotes or rolls back.
5. **Serve.** Engines mmap the released safetensors, load `tokenizer.json` in `tl-tok`, allocate the C KV pool, and heartbeat to the gateway. A request to `POST /v1/chat/completions` passes auth (HMAC key lookup), the usage policy (rules plus a linear head over the engine's `/v1/embeddings`, D33), the token bucket, and the response cache. It is routed by consistent hash on the first prompt block with bounded loads and queue depth. In unified mode the gateway proxies SSE from the engine. In disaggregated mode it runs the Prefill then resume flow of 2.7.
6. **Agent.** `cmd/agent-docsqa` uses the learner's agent SDK. Its `Provider` points at their gateway, which serves SmolLM2-135M-Instruct on their engine with tool calls (L10.9), or at a frontier API. Its RAG index covers their own `docs/` and the course chapters, using gateway `/v1/embeddings` and BM25 fused with RRF. Run as `AgentRun` workflows, each LLM call and tool call is an activity, so a crashed agent replays to the step it reached.
7. **Evaluate.** `<system> eval --suite docsqa --ab base=smol-135m,exp=tinystories-sft` runs deterministic scorers first (exact match, citation coverage, retrieval recall@k), then the LLM judge and the pairwise judge, and writes `results.jsonl` and `summary.json` with bootstrap CIs. The release gate in step 4 reads these numbers.
8. **Observe.** Every component exports OTLP to the collector, which feeds Tempo and Prometheus. Grafana shows one trace from `<system> train` through workflow and activity spans to `train.step`, and another from an HTTP request through `gateway.route`, `kv.transfer`, and `engine.decode`. SLO dashboards drive the burn-rate alerts that `ss drill` scenarios are graded against.

## 3. Course layout in supersource

### 3.1 Placement rules

1. **Machinery goes in `course/`.** Contracts, hidden references, tests, mutants, solve keys, milestone and drill specs, fixtures, the harness, and the fixture oracle.
2. **Chapters go in the tracks.** A chapter is a file inside the topic directory that owns its concept. A new topic directory is created only when no existing topic owns the concept. Tracks stay top level.
3. **The guide goes in `paths/course*/`.** The front door, the system map, pass intros, and milestone pages.
4. **Only `course/contracts/` is published** from `course/`, so chapter links to contracts resolve on the site. The rest of `course/` (references, mutants, solve keys, tests, fixtures, harness) and all of `archive/` are never published to the site or the book (`SKIP` in `site/scripts/sync-content.mjs` keeps `course/contracts/`; `scripts/assemble_book.py` excludes `course/` and `archive/` and renders contract links as repository URLs).

### 3.4 Registry: `course/modules/<ID>.toml`

```toml
id        = "L8.3"
title     = "Paged KV cache"
kind      = "build"                 # build | solve | proof | practice | drill | side (milestones live in course/milestones/)
lang      = ["python"]              # one or more of python | c | rust | go | cuda | ops | docs | none
pass      = 6                       # course pass that first teaches it (7.2)
chapter   = "ml/08-tinyllm/p08-inference/03-paged-kv-cache.md"
contract  = ["contracts/py/tinyllm/infer/paged.pyi"]
deps      = ["L8.2", "rt.04"]       # module ids whose code this module's units or course tests call
reading   = []                      # prerequisites whose code is not called: module ids (concepts, solve sets, ports) or track paths
used_by   = ["L9.4", "L10.4"]       # call sites: module ids only, never milestones or side quests; non-empty for build
units     = ["python/tinyllm/infer/paged.py"]   # learner-repo files this module owns (D15)
upgrades  = []                      # units taken over from an earlier module (spiral)
milestone = "MS-L8"
ci        = "pr"                    # pr | nightly | local

[tests]
dir       = "course/tests/L8.3"       # Go: course/tests/go/<id_>/, Rust: course/tests/rust/<id_>.rs (3.2)
smoke     = ["alloc_free_roundtrip", "append_then_read"]  # rerun cumulatively by dependents
timeout_s = 120
determinism_runs = 2

[fixtures]
files = ["course/fixtures/L8.3/kv_blocks_small.npz"]

[learner_tests]                     # omitted: no graded learner tests for this module
rung      = 4
path      = "python/tests/l8-3-paged"
threshold = 0.80
required_mutants = ["s01", "s02"]
time_budget_s = 30
```

`modules.tsv` (generated) columns: `id, kind, lang, pass, chapter, units, deps, used_by, milestone`.

Registry invariants (checked by `ss verify course`): for a `build` module `A`, `used_by(A)` is exactly the set of non-side modules whose `deps` contain `A` (mirror rule; conceptual prerequisites and ports sit in `reading`, so they do not count); the `pass` of every dep and every `reading` module is at most the module's `pass`; every `used_by` module's `pass` is at least the module's `pass`; a `build` module has at least one `used_by` entry that is not a side quest. One exemption: a module that `upgrades` a unit inherits that unit's call sites, which may sit in earlier passes (ag.12 taking over `EvalSuite`, which dur.12 calls).

### 3.5 Id grammar

```
ID     := MATH | SPINE | CAP | SOLVE | AREA | SIDE | MS
MATH   := "M" 2DIGIT "." DIGIT{1,2}              # M04.1
SPINE  := "L" DIGIT{1,2} "." DIGIT               # L7.3; ".0" = tracer v0 module
CAP    := "C1" | "C2"
SOLVE  := "S-M" 2DIGIT [a-z]?                    # S-M08, S-M07a (lettered part, by pass)
AREA   := ("lang"|"ds"|"rt"|"data"|"dur"|"gw"|"ag"|"load"|"dep"|"obs"|"ops"|"craft"|"ethics"|"review"|"field"|"iv") "." 2DIGIT   # ".00" = tracer v0
SIDE   := "sq." [a-z0-9-]+
MS     := "MS-" [A-Za-z0-9-]+                    # MS-L7, MS-gateway, MS-P1
suffix := "+cuda"                                # optional CUDA variant (local only)
```

Harness regex: `^(M[0-9]{2}\.[0-9]{1,2}|L[0-9]{1,2}\.[0-9]|C[12]|S-M[0-9]{2}[a-z]?|(lang|ds|rt|data|dur|gw|ag|load|dep|obs|ops|craft|ethics|review|field|iv)\.[0-9]{2}|sq\.[a-z0-9-]+|MS-[A-Za-z0-9-]+)(\+cuda)?$`. None of the practice kinds (`predict`, `build`, `reattempt`) match it, so `ss start build c 02` is unaffected.

## 4. Module catalog

### 4.0 Conventions

**Paths.** Python paths are relative to `python/` (so `tinyllm/num/diff.py` is `python/tinyllm/num/diff.py`). C, Rust, and Go paths are from the learner repo root.

**Prereqs and Call sites columns.** Cells hold module ids. `X to Y` is an id range that the registry expands. The Prereqs column shows `deps` and `reading` together; the registry separates them (3.4). A prerequisite that is not a module is written `reading: <path>`. A Go re-implementation of a Python module (the Go PCG32, Poisson arrivals, bootstrap, BM25 scoring) is a separate unit owned by the Go module, noted as "re-implemented by", never listed as a call site. Concepts first used by a systems chapter (error budgets and burn rate in obs.03, k-means and k-means++ in ag.07, MRR and nDCG in ag.10, Cohen's kappa in ag.11, CRC in dur.01) are defined in that chapter's beat 2.

**Tests column.** One-letter abbreviations of the `KIND` vocabulary (D26). Every course test carries the full word in its header (5.12).

| Code | KIND | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| U | `unit` / `boundary` | table-driven cases, including the chapter's worked example |
| G | `gradcheck` | analytic gradient vs the **frozen** `tests/_lib/gradcheck.py` (central differences, float64, eps 1e-6, rtol 1e-5, atol 1e-7), never the learner's own `M04.1` (D35) |
| O | `golden` | oracle values recorded by a maintainer script (torch, HF, tiktoken, sacrebleu, scipy, sklearn) in `.npz`/`.jsonl` |
| E | `differential` | two implementations agree: cache vs recompute, C vs numpy, Rust vs the learner's Python, chunked vs whole; tolerance from the frozen `tests/_lib/close.py` bounds (the same formulas `M09.3` teaches). A live Rust-vs-Python or C-vs-Python diff also checks one side against the oracle fixture, so two equally wrong implementations fail |
| I | `property` | an algebraic law over seeded random inputs: roundtrip, causality, sums to 1, no leaks |
| S | `statistical` | a sampling distribution checked by exact enumeration, or chi-square at a fixed seed with p > 1e-3 |
| L | `learning` | trains a tiny config (d <= 64) for a **fixed step count** with a timeout of 10x the reference's time (the "under 8 s" figures in the tables are reference times); pass when the metric is at most `mean_ref + 3 sd_ref` over 5 reference seeds, stored in `ref-thresholds` |
| C | `conformance` | contract suite shared with the reference (OpenAPI, ABI, formats, replay histories) |
| F | `fault` | fault injection: kill loops, failpoints, allocation failure, chaos proxy |
| B | `bench` | perf budget relative to `ss bench --calibrate`; gates `ss bench course --assert`, never `ss check`. **Every ratio or latency bound is a B test** (local or bench job only); `pr` checks stay functional |

**Budgets.** Each module's course tests run in under 10 s on a laptop CPU (fault suites under 60 s). Python course tests use only numpy, the stdlib, and the harness helpers. Learner Python units may import numpy, the stdlib, and the `allowed-deps.toml` entries for their package (`corpus`: `pyarrow`, `zstandard`; `tinyllm.io.telemetry`: `opentelemetry-sdk`, `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http`). Model weights are never committed; milestones download them through the learner's own `{tinyllm} pull` (`L7.9`) or `ss fetch`.

**Overlay and frozen helpers.** Course tests import `tinyllm.*` for the code under test, and the learner's units shadow the references (5.4). Assertions, gradient checks, and RNG construction always come from the frozen harness helpers (D35): `tests/_lib` in Python, `ss_test.h` in C, `tl-contracts::testing` in Rust, `contracts/go/testing` in Go. The learner's own `gradcheck` (M04.1), tolerance helpers (M09.3), and PCG32 (M06.3) are graded by their own modules, including a planted-wrong-gradient test for `gradcheck`, and never decide another module's verdict.

**Math gates.** Each solve set is split into lettered parts by pass (4.2). A pass closes with `ss check` on every math module it teaches and on the solve parts listed for it in 7.4, so no solve item lags the build module it belongs to. The "Call sites" column is where the code lights up from the learner's own entry points.

### 4.2 Solve problem sets

Answer kinds: `expr`, `equation`, `number`, `interval`, `set`, `matrix`, `vector`, `basis`, `bool`, `choice`, and `proof` (self-graded rubric in v1; Lean later). Checker rules are in 5.5. A set part passes at 80% or more of auto-checked items plus every rubric item attested.

**Parts by pass.** A set whose build modules span several passes is split into lettered parts, each placed in the pass that teaches its modules, so no solve item lags its build module (4.0 math gates). Unsplit sets sit in the pass of their topic.

### 4.3 LLM spine catalog (`tinyllm`)

Parts 0 to 8 are Python/numpy and are the semantic source of truth. Part 9 is C behind `tinyllm.h`, first proven from Python (`--backend c`). Part 10 is the Rust engine over the C kernels. A native port is proven by **differential tests against the learner's own Python**, never against a black box. Two tracer modules (`L0.0`, `L10.0`) build the thin end-to-end version in Pass 1; later modules upgrade their units.

#### Tracer modules (Pass 1)

| ID | Module | Core | Lang | Path | Prereqs | Call sites | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L0.0 | Byte-level bigram LM from counts (vocabulary = the 256 byte values, D32), logits through the C matmul via ctypes, safetensors writer v0 (F32 only). Beat 2 is self-contained "just enough" math with forward links: counts to probabilities, `log` and `exp`, negative log-likelihood, add-one smoothing, temperature, sampling by inverse CDF (M00.1, M07.1, M07.2, M11.1 teach each properly later) | core, tracer | Py | `tinyllm/lm/bigram.py` (upgraded by L0.5), `tinyllm/io/safetensors.py` (v0, upgraded by L0.6) | M03.1, rt.01, lang.01 | L10.0 serves it (`tl_arch = bigram`, `tl_tokenizer = bytes`); L0.5 retrains it with autograd | U (hand example), I (rows sum to 1), O (safetensors bytes identical to the pinned `safetensors` library) |
| L10.0 | Your first endpoint: Rust std-only HTTP/1.1 + SSE server for API v0, calling the C matmul through a minimal `extern "C"` block; byte tokenizer; parses `traceparent` and exports one span per request as hand-written OTLP/HTTP JSON | core, tracer | Rust | `rust/crates/tl-serve/src/http.rs` (v0, upgraded by L10.5), `rust/crates/tl-sys/src/lib.rs` (v0, upgraded by L10.1) | M03.1, rt.01, L0.0, lang.04, lang.05 | gw.00 upstream, dep.00 image, obs.00 | C (`openapi:v0` cases: framing, `[DONE]`, `max_tokens`), U (request parser on malformed input; OTLP JSON body validates against the OTLP schema subset) |

```python
class BigramLM:
    def fit_counts(self, ids: NDArray, vocab_size: int, alpha: float = 1.0) -> None
    def logits(self, ids: NDArray) -> NDArray                 # [T, V] = onehot(ids) @ W via tl_matmul_f32
    def nll(self, ids: NDArray) -> float
    def sample(self, prefix: list[int], n: int, temperature: float, seed: int) -> list[int]
def save_safetensors(path: str, tensors: dict[str, NDArray], meta: dict[str, str]) -> None   # v0: F32
```

Tracer sampling is greedy or seeded but not yet parity-checked. `L0.0` may use `numpy.random.default_rng(seed)`; it is the only lint exemption to the RNG rule, and it expires at MS-P2: `L0.5` takes over `bigram.py` (`upgrades`), adds the autograd-trained `BigramLogits` model, and switches its sampler to the learner's PCG32. The tracer role takes `--model-dir --port` (no TOML parser in a std-only crate); `--config` arrives with `L10.5`.

| L0.6 | safetensors I/O (all dtypes), atomic checkpoints, and the token-stream reader: memory-mapped `formats/tokens-bin.md` shards with random-window batches and a `data_cursor{shard, offset}` that saves and restores | core | Py | `tinyllm/io/safetensors.py` (upgrades L0.0), `tinyllm/io/checkpoint.py`, `tinyllm/io/tokens.py` | M09.1, L0.0 | L2.1, L2.2, L7.9, L10.1 mmap layout, C1 trainer, dur.09 resume | O (byte-identical to the pinned `safetensors` library), I (a crash mid-write leaves the prior checkpoint valid; resume is bitwise, including the token cursor: N steps, save, restore, M steps equals N+M steps) |

**MS-L0.**

1. `{tinyllm} gradcheck --suite all` exits 0 with max relative error under 1e-5.
2. The tracer bigram retrained as `BigramLogits` by the learner's autograd (L0.5) reaches the count-MLE NLL within 1e-3 nats, writes a checkpoint, and is served by the **unchanged** tracer engine (MS-P1 smoke still green).
3. `{tinyllm} train mlp --data {fixture:small-corpora/digits.npz} --hidden 64 --epochs 30 --seed 0 --ckpt {out}` gives `{"test_acc": >= 0.95}`.
4. Kill and resume: `{tinyllm} train bigram --data {fixture:small-corpora/tinyshakespeare.bin} --max-steps 100` then `--resume` gives a final loss **bitwise equal** to the uninterrupted run, token cursor included. Reference time under 60 s.

Pass: `ppl_kn4` within 0.5% of the reference; `ppl_nplm` at the calibrated threshold and below the bigram; generation identical across the two runs; both report `bpb` (M00.1 `bits_per_byte`). Reference time under 3 min. The NPLM checkpoint (`tl_arch = "nplm"`) runs through `{tinyllm}` and the L6.7 zoo; the Rust engine keeps serving the bigram until L10.1 (D32).

Reference time under 10 min; the `--smoke` variant runs 300 steps.

**MS-L7.** (1) `{tinyllm} pull HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M` with the learner's downloader. (2) `{tinyllm} logits --model {models}/SmolLM2-135M --prompts {fixture:smollm2-parity/prompts.jsonl} --out {out}/logits.npz`: last-position logits vs HF fp32 max abs <= 1e-3 and identical top-5. (3) `{tinyllm} generate --model ... --greedy --max-tokens 32` is token-exact against HF greedy on 8 prompts. (4) `{tinyllm} info --model ...` reports `params` equal to HF `num_parameters()`. Steps 1 to 4 run nightly in CI; PR CI runs the same steps on `{asset:tiny-hf-models/tiny-llama-2l}`. Greedy comparisons use oracle prompts whose top-2 logit margin is at least 1e-3 at every step (5.7 near-tie rule).

(1) `{tinyllm} generate --cache {none,contiguous,paged} --greedy`: `{"cache_equiv": true}` under the near-tie rule (paged compares against contiguous with `--kv-dtype f16`). (2) `{tinyllm} eval ppl --quant {int8,q4_g32,fp8_e4m3} --data {asset:course-corpora/wiki-mini.txt}`: ppl increase <= reference degradation + 1 point per scheme (int4 within 5%).

(4) `{tinyllm} bench decode --tokens 256` reports `cache_speedup` (a `perf` step, `ci = "local"`, bound `>= 5`). (5) the L8.4 course tests pass from `cargo test`.

#### L9 Kernels in C (`ml/08-tinyllm/p09-kernels/`)

Build contract: the learner's `c/Makefile` produces `c/build/libtinyllm.{a,dylib,so}`; `SANITIZE=1` adds `-fsanitize=address,undefined`. The harness builds its own objects for tests (5.4) in two variants: a sanitized build used only by the C test harness, and an unsanitized `-O2` build that serves ctypes, Rust, and benchmarks (an ASan library cannot be loaded into an uninstrumented Python on macOS, and stable Rust cannot link an ASan archive). The Makefile is only for the learner's entry points. Each kernel module is tested twice: through the ctypes differential suite in Python (unsanitized build), and through the C harness under sanitizers. Signatures are in 2.4. Runtime pieces (`rt.01` to `rt.03`) live in this part's chapter directory but are catalogued in 4.4.

| L9.5 | Fused int4/int8 dequant matmul (W4A32, decode GEMV) | core | C | `c/src/kernels/qmatmul.c` | L8.5, L9.1, M09.3 | L10.1 quantized forward | E (vs dequantize then numpy), B (M=1, N=K=2048: >= 2x faster than f32) |

| L9.7 | Python C backend: per-op dispatch of the L7.9 forward to `libtinyllm`, with a load-time op check (`--backend c --check` compares each op against numpy within the M09.3 bound) | core | Py | `tinyllm/backend/c.py` | L9.1 to L9.6, rt.01 loader, M09.3, L7.9 | L10.1 (its differential oracle: the Rust runner's logits are compared with `--backend c` logits), `{tinyllm} --backend c` | E (logits vs numpy backend within 1e-3 rel on `tiny-llama-2l`), I (varlen batch == per-sequence calls) |

CUDA variants (`_cuda` suffix, same signatures, `ss check L9.3+cuda` on GPU machines only) are the side quest `sq.cuda-kernels`.

**MS-L9.** (1) `{tinyllm} generate --model SmolLM2-135M --backend c --greedy` is token-identical to `--backend numpy` under the near-tie rule. (2) `{tinyllm} bench --backend {numpy,c} --decode 128` reports `speedup_c` (a `perf` step, `ci = "local"`, bound `>= 3` relative to calibration). (3) The course C harness for every L9 and rt module is sanitizer-clean.

| L10.2 | Continuous batching scheduler: admission by free blocks, priority (from `X-TL-Priority` / `PrefillRequest.priority`) with aging, preemption by recompute | core | Rust | `tl-engine/src/sched.rs` | L8.3, ds.06, M05.1, L10.1 | L10.3 to L10.6, serve loop | I (fake-model simulation: every request finishes, no block leak, bounded max wait under a fake clock), E (batched greedy == single-request, which holds because the kernels are batch-invariant, 2.4), F (KV exhaustion forces preemption and outputs stay identical) |
| L10.3 | Chunked prefill (mixed prefill + decode batches) | core | Rust | `tl-engine/src/chunk.rs` | L10.2, L9.3 `q_offset` | L10.5 serve loop (the TTFT/TPOT tradeoff is measured through L10.7 metrics) | E (chunked == unchunked logits, bitwise given chunk-invariant kernels), I (token budget never exceeded) |
| L10.4 | Block manager with prefix cache (`--prefix-cache=none|hash|radix`) | core | Rust | `tl-engine/src/block_manager.rs` | L8.4, rt.04, ds.02, L10.2 | L10.5 serve loop, L10.6, L10.8 (gw.05 routes on its hit metrics over gRPC) | E (identical outputs with and without cache), I (refcounts), B (shared-system-prompt TTFT >= 2x better; hash vs radix compared) |
| L10.5 | `tl-serve`: OpenAI-compatible HTTP + SSE on tokio + hyper, `--config` via `runtime.toml`, chat template, bounded admission channel (429 + `Retry-After`), abort on disconnect, SIGTERM drain, `/v1/tokenize`, `/v1/embeddings`; upgrades L10.0 | core | Rust | `tl-serve/src/{lib,http,sse,openai,template}.rs` | L10.2 to L10.4, L1.5, lang.09, reading: L8.2 | L10.6, L10.7, L10.9 (gw.04, ag.01, load.01, and L12.3 reach it over HTTP) | C (`ss conform openapi:v1 --target engine`, about 60 cases, plus the official `openai` Python client), F (disconnect frees blocks within one step per `/metrics`; full queue gives 429) |

| L10.7 | Serving metrics, SLO histograms, OTel spans and propagation (replaces the tracer's hand-written OTLP) | core | Rust | `tl-serve/src/{metrics,telemetry}.rs` | M07.4, obs.00, L10.5 | serve loop (load.01, obs.03, and drills read its metrics) | C (exposition parse; names and buckets match `otel/metrics.yaml`), I (counters monotone; histogram count == requests) |
| L10.8 | Speculative decoding in the engine: prompt-lookup and n-gram drafts over the request's context, greedy acceptance at temperature 0 and M07.6 rejection otherwise, KV rollback on reject | core (D37) | Rust | `tl-engine/src/spec.rs` | L8.6, L10.2, L10.4 | serve loop (`[engine].speculative`), metric `tl.engine.spec_accept_rate` | E (accepted tokens == the learner's Python L8.6 on shared draft and target logits; greedy spec output == greedy without spec), I (blocks conserved across rollbacks), B (decode tokens/s with prompt-lookup on a repetitive fixture) |

**MS-L10.** The engine starts from the learner's `[entry].engine`. `ss milestone MS-L10` checks: (1) `ss conform openapi:v1 --target engine` 100%; (2) seeded determinism across two runs of the engine, `ss parity sampler` (Rust and Python sampler equal on fixture logits), and the engine's **greedy** stream equals `{tinyllm} generate --greedy` under the near-tie rule; (3) 64 concurrent requests from the learner's loadgen complete with `p50_ttft_ms` and `p50_tpot_ms` reported and KV at baseline afterwards; `throughput_vs_sequential >= 3` is a separate `perf` step (`ci = "local"`); (4) disconnect mid-stream aborts and frees blocks; (5) disaggregated mode (`role=prefill` + two `role=decode`, ports allocated by the runner) passes the conformance subset and survives a transfer reset; (6) with `speculative.draft = "prompt_lookup"`, greedy output is unchanged; (7) a `tools` request to `{asset:smollm2-135m-instruct}` returns schema-valid `tool_calls` (nightly; PR CI uses `tiny-llama-2l` with a fixture chat template, where the constraint alone guarantees validity).

Tensor parallelism (Megatron column/row) and the 1F1B pipeline schedule are side quests `sq.tensor-parallel` and `sq.pipeline-parallel` (no call site on one laptop); `ml/04-llm-systems/diagrams/parallelism.d2` is their figure.

```python
@contextmanager

class DynamicLossScaler:

class ZeroOptimizer(Optimizer): def __init__(self, opt_cls, params, comm: Comm, stage: Literal[1, 2, 3], **kw)
```

**MS-L11.** `{tinyllm} train llama --cfg {fixture:configs/llama-2m.json} --micro-batch 8 --accum 4 --bf16 --checkpoint-activations --steps 300`: loss within 2% of an fp32 run without accumulation, and lower `peak_mem` (tracemalloc). Optional: `--world 4 --zero 2` matches the single-process run.

#### C1 Capstone: TinyStories, owned end to end

| Stage | What runs | Learner modules exercised |
|---|---|---|
| Data | TinyStories through `CorpusBuild` (fetch, filter with the KN perplexity filter, dedup, decontamination, PII, shards); the L1.2 trainer (vocab 4096) on a **fixed 16 MB sample** (pure-Python BPE on the full corpus would take hours), and the same sample for the L1.4 Unigram ablation; then L1.5 encode to `uint16` `.bin` | data.01 to data.09, L1.2, L1.4, L1.5, L1.6, L2.1 |
| Model | `LlamaConfig(vocab=4096, d=320, layers=8, heads=8, kv_heads=4, d_ff=864, ctx=512, tied)`, about 10.4M params, checked by M05.1 | L7.1 to L7.5, L7.9 |
| Train | AdamW + WSD + clipping, bf16 emulation, accumulation; `TrainRun` (dur.11) segments as durable activities with idempotent checkpoint resume; the `TokenStream` cursor (L0.6) makes resume bitwise; the train worker may run on the host (2.13) | M10.3, M10.4, L11.1, L0.6, dur.06, dur.09, dur.11; optional M10.6 A/B |
| Ablations (core, `short` config) | tokenizer: BPE vs Unigram; attention: MLA vs GQA at equal KV bytes; MLP: MoE vs dense at equal active parameters. Each is one `short` run reported with a paired CI | L1.4, L7.6, L7.8, M07.5 |
| Evaluate | val loss and bpb with CI; deterministic quality checks (repeat-8-gram rate, KN ppl of samples); long-context bpb at 1024 with YaRN vs none (L7.4); scaling-law fit with `lstsq` over three `short`-family sizes (0.3M, 1M, 2.5M params); the **model-zoo baseline table** (KN-4, NPLM, LSTM, GPT, and the C1 Llama, bpb on the same TinyStories val file, plus the seq2seq, classification, and word-similarity rows) run by `EvalSuite`; the LLM judge (ag.11) is added when Pass 10 lands and rerun by MS-P10 | L6.7, L7.4, M07.4, M07.5, M03.5, dur.11, later ag.09 to ag.12 |
| Release | safetensors + `config.json` + `tokenizer.json`, `ModelRelease` gate (dur.12), model card, data ledger | L0.6, L7.9, data.08, ethics.03, dur.12 |
| Serve | Rust engine (q4 and f32) behind the learner's gateway | L8.5, L9.1 to L9.7, L10.1 to L10.9, gw.01 to gw.07 |

Compute: about 6·N·D = 6 x 1e7 x 1e8 = 6e15 FLOP, roughly 4 to 12 h on an M-series laptop with numpy and Accelerate BLAS (uncertain). The `short` config (2.5M params, 2e7 tokens) finishes in under 1 h and is accepted at a looser threshold; the three ablations and the two smaller scaling sizes add about 3 to 4 h of `short`-family runs.

**MS-C1.** (1) `{tinyllm} eval ppl --model {ckpt} --data {asset:course-corpora/ts-val.bin}`: val loss at the calibrated threshold for the chosen config (full or `short`). (2) 20 seeded samples pass the deterministic quality scorers. (3) OpenAI conformance subset passes against `{deploy.gateway_url}` with an API key. (4) Artifacts exist: model card, data ledger, ADR for vocab size (citing the tokenizer ablation), ADR for architecture (citing the MLA and MoE ablations), zoo baseline table. (5) One trace spans `{ctl} train` to `train.step`.

#### L12 Post-training (optional, after C1, produces C2)

| ID | Module | Core | Lang | Path | Prereqs | Call sites | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L12.1 | SFT: chat rendering, assistant-only loss, packing with document masks | optional | Py | `tinyllm/post/sft.py` | L6.6, L0.3, L10.5 template | C2 | E (Python renderer byte-identical to the Rust renderer), I (loss on assistant tokens only; no cross-document attention) |
| L12.2 | DPO (+ IPO variant) | optional | Py | `tinyllm/post/dpo.py` | S-M10b, M11.1 | C2 | G, O (TRL loss fixture), I (loss = log 2 when policy == ref) |
| L12.3 | GRPO with verifiable rewards, rollouts through the learner's server | optional | Py | `tinyllm/post/grpo.py` | M11.1 k3, M07.4, L8.1, L10.5 | C2 | O (TRL GRPO loss fixture), I (zero advantage gives zero policy grad), L (toy: reward +0.3 in 50 steps) |
| L12.4 | Distillation (forward/reverse KL, on-policy) | optional | Py | `tinyllm/post/distill.py` | M11.1 | C2 alternative | O, I |

```python
def render_chat(messages: Sequence[dict], template: str) -> tuple[list[int], NDArray]      # ids, assistant_mask
def sft_loss(logits: Tensor, ids: NDArray, assistant_mask: NDArray) -> Tensor
def pack_examples(examples: Sequence[tuple[list[int], NDArray]], max_len: int) -> list[dict]  # ids, mask, positions, doc_ids
def sequence_logps(model, ids: NDArray, mask: NDArray) -> Tensor
def dpo_loss(pc: Tensor, pr: Tensor, rc: NDArray, rr: NDArray, beta: float = 0.1, label_smoothing: float = 0.0,
             kind: Literal['dpo','ipo'] = 'dpo') -> tuple[Tensor, dict[str, float]]
def group_advantages(rewards: NDArray, group: int, eps: float = 1e-6, scale: bool = True) -> NDArray
def grpo_loss(logp_new: Tensor, logp_old: NDArray, logp_ref: NDArray, adv: NDArray, mask: NDArray,
              clip_eps: float = 0.2, beta: float = 0.04) -> Tensor                           # k3 KL
def rollout(server_url: str, prompts: Sequence[str], n: int, p: SamplingParams) -> list[list[str]]   # the D9 HTTP exception
def contains_required_words(story: str, words: Sequence[str]) -> float
```

**MS-C2** (optional). `{tinyllm} post sft --base {ckpt} --data {fixture:post/ts-instruct.jsonl}`, `{tinyllm} post grpo --reward required_words --rollout-url {engine.api_base}`, then serve the result as `tinystories-instruct` through the same gateway. Pass: held-out reward >= base + 0.2, confirmed by a paired permutation test p < 0.05 run through the learner's Go A/B experiment runner (ag.12).

### 4.4 Systems layers

The spine owns model math, kernels, and inference algorithms. This section owns everything else: data structures, the C runtime, the corpus pipeline, the durable engine, the gateway, the agent SDK, and load generation. Where a systems chapter implements a spine algorithm (for example the engine scheduler), the spine owns the prose and the module id.

#### Fault and determinism kit (`course/testkit/`)

| Kit | Language | What it gives tests |
|---|---|---|
| `proc.KillLoop(cmd, n, jitter)` | Go | spawns a learner entry, SIGKILLs it at random offsets, restarts, then checks invariants |
| `failpoint` | Go, Rust, C, Python | named failpoints required by contracts, enabled with `TL_FAILPOINTS="dur/log/after-write=crash"` |
| `effects` | Go (HTTP) | external side-effect sink that records idempotency keys; `AssertExactlyOnce(keys)`; the worker's `--test-activities` flag registers `tl.test.Append`, which writes to it |
| `clock` | Go, Rust, Python | fake clock; every time-dependent contract takes `Clock` (`Now`, `After`, `NewTimer`) |
| `faketool` provider | Go | rule-based fake OpenAI-compatible provider keyed on the last user or tool message (replaces request-hash cassettes, which never match learner-built prompts) |
| `chaosproxy` | Go | TCP proxy: latency, drop, reset mid-stream, half-open, bandwidth limit |
| `otlpsink`, `promscrape` | Go | in-test OTLP receiver and Prometheus scraper with span-tree and metric assertions |
| `flakyhttp` | Python | fixture HTTP server with truncated bodies, 5xx, Range support, and checksum lies |
| allocator fail-after-n | C | allocation failure injection through `tl_set_allocator` |
| sanitizers | C, Rust | ASan+UBSan on the sanitized C test build; TSan on `rt.03`; Rust TSan on `L10.2` and Miri on `tl-ds` unsafe blocks run **nightly only** on a pinned nightly toolchain |
| counting allocator | C | leak detection on every platform: the harness installs a counting allocator through `tl_set_allocator` and asserts zero live allocations at exit (Apple clang has no LeakSanitizer) |

#### ds: data structures with call sites (`algorithms/16-systems-data-structures/`)

| ID | Title | Lang | Path | Prereqs | Interface | Call sites | Tests | Lights up at |

| ds.03 | Intrusive list + LRU | C | `c/src/ds/list.c`, `lru.c` | ds.02 | 2.4 | rt.04 evictable cached blocks | U (splice, safe iteration), I (LRU order vs a model) | eviction counters on `/metrics` |
| ds.04 | Binary heap top-k `tl_topk_f32` (ties: lower index wins); builds on the ds.06 chapter (the first heap chapter) | C | `c/src/ds/topk.c` | ds.01, reading: ds.06 | 2.4 | L10.1 Rust sampler top-k via `tl-sys` | U (k=0, k>n, NaN gives `TL_EINVAL`), E (vs full sort; vs L8.1 Python top-k on fixture logits) | engine sampling with `top_k=40` |

| ds.06 | Binary heap with lazy deletion (generation counters); **the first heap chapter** | Rust | `rust/crates/tl-ds/src/heap.rs` | lang.04 | `Heap<T, F: Fn(&T,&T)->Ordering>`: `push/pop/peek/len`; `LazyHeap` | L1.5 merge queue; L10.2 waiting queue | U (stability), E (vs sorted Vec; heap BPE == naive O(n²) BPE ids) | `{tl-tok} bench` |
| ds.07 | Radix tree over token ids with index-linked LRU leaf list | Rust | `rust/crates/tl-ds/src/radix.rs` | ds.05, reading: M06.2 | `RadixTree<V>`: `match_prefix(&[u32]) -> (usize, Vec<NodeId>)`, `insert`, `lock/unlock`, `evict(n, FnMut(V))` | L8.4 prefix cache | U (edge split/merge), I (model-based vs naive trie; locked never evicted; LRU over unlocked leaves) | engine `--prefix-cache=radix`, shared-prefix load hit ratio >= 0.6 |
| ds.08 | Bloom filter | Rust | `rust/crates/tl-ds/src/bloom.rs`, `rust/crates/tl-py/src/bloom.rs` | L1.5 (`tl-py` crate root), reading: S-M06b (FP rate, optimal k) | `Bloom::with_rate(n, p)`, `insert`, `contains`, `union`, `to_bytes/from_bytes` | data.03 exact dedup | U (m and k formulas), I (no false negatives), S (FP rate within 3σ of the binomial prediction) | `{corpus} run --until dedup_exact` |
| ds.09 | Consistent hash ring with bounded loads | Go | `go/ds/ring/ring.go` | lang.06, reading: S-M07d (balls into bins) | `ring.New(vnodes int, h func([]byte) uint64)`, `Add/Remove`, `Get(key)`, `GetBounded(key, load func(string) int, c float64)` | gw.05 affinity routing | U, S (key movement on Add about K/N, chi-square), I (bounded variant never exceeds `ceil(c*avg)`) | gateway `route_policy=affinity`, per-replica hit rate in the load report |

The engine flag `--prefix-cache=hash|radix` deliberately gives both `ds.02` (hash prefix index in C) and `ds.07` (radix tree in Rust) a production call site; `L10.4` benchmarks one against the other.

#### data: corpus pipeline (`data-engineering/05-corpus-pipeline/`, Python `python/corpus/`)

Learner Python units may import `pyarrow` and `zstandard` (listed for `corpus` in `allowed-deps.toml`; the data.06 card says so). The `Doc`, `Stage`, and `compose` definitions above live in `corpus/stage.py`, owned by data.02.

#### gw: gateway control plane (Go)

Middleware order is a contract tested by `gw.01`: `requestid -> otel -> recover -> authn -> policy -> ratelimit -> cache -> route -> proxy -> meter`.

| ID | Title | Path | Prereqs | Interface | Call sites | Tests | Lights up at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gw.00 | Tracer gateway: static API-key check, SSE pass-through without buffering, `traceparent` and `X-Request-Id` propagation | `go/gateway/proxy/` (v0, upgraded by gw.04) | lang.06, reading: L10.0 | `func NewProxy(cfg Config) http.Handler` | gw.01 (wrapped by the server), gw.04 (upgrades it) | C (`openapi:v0` through the gateway), U (401 in the OpenAI error shape) | `curl -N` with a key through the gateway to the tracer engine |
| gw.01 | Server skeleton, composition root, graceful shutdown | `go/gateway/server/`, `go/config/` (runtime.toml loader, `TL_<SECTION>__<KEY>` overrides) | gw.00, reading: ai-platform-engineering design patterns (decorator = middleware) | `func New(cfg Config, d Deps) *http.Server`; `Deps{Keys, Limiter, Router, Cache, Ledger, Policy, Clock, Tracer}` | gw.02 to gw.08 (their middleware and handlers run in its chain) | U (middleware order via a recording middleware; `go/config` precedence and the `__` separator against `conformance/config/`), F (SIGTERM drains streams up to a deadline; `/readyz` flips before drain) | `{gateway} --config deploy/runtime.dev.toml` |

| gw.03 | Rate limiting: RPM token bucket + TPM reserve/settle (practice `go/07`) | `go/gateway/limit/` | gw.01, reading: S-M07d (queueing, Little's law), practice `go/07` README | `Limiter{Reserve(ctx, key string, c Cost) (Reservation, error)}`; `Reservation{Settle(actual Cost); Cancel()}`; `Cost{Requests, Tokens int}` (prompt via engine `/v1/tokenize` + `max_tokens`) | gw.01 chain | U (fake clock: burst, refill, settle refunds unused tokens), race detector under 1k goroutines, C (`x-ratelimit-*` headers, 429 + `Retry-After`) | low-tier key under `{loadgen} --rate 50` gets 429s at the configured rate |
| gw.04 | SSE streaming proxy (upgrades gw.00) | `go/gateway/proxy/` | gw.00, gw.01, reading: L10.5, ai-platform-engineering/03 | `StreamProxy(w, r, up *http.Response, o StreamObserver) error`; `StreamObserver{OnFirstByte, OnChunk, OnDone(Usage)}` | gw.05, gw.07 TTFT (ag.01 reaches it over HTTP) | C (recorded OpenAI streams pass through byte-exact), F (client disconnect cancels upstream within 100 ms, proven by engine stats; chaos-proxy reset mid-stream emits an SSE error event), B (first-byte latency within 5 ms of upstream) | `curl -N` through the gateway to `tl-serve` |
| gw.05 | Worker registry (`tl.control.v1`), routing, cascades, failover, disaggregated orchestration | `go/gateway/route/` | ds.09, gw.01, reading: L10.6, ai-platform-engineering/11 | `Router{Route(ctx, req *InferenceRequest, ex Exclusions) (Target, error)}`; policies `weighted`, `least_outstanding`, `affinity` (ds.09 on the first prompt block hash, bounded by queue depth), `cascade{Small, Large Target; Accept func(Result) bool}` (mean logprob >= τ); `EngineControl` client (Prefill, Info, Drain) | gw.01 chain (load.01, ops.01, and dur.12's canary exercise it) | F (a backend killed before first byte is retried elsewhere; after first byte the request fails and is never spliced; 3 missed heartbeats evict), C (cascade threshold sweep on fixture logprobs reproduces the expected cost/quality curve), E (disaggregated == unified output, greedy) | `route_policy=affinity` with two decode workers |
| gw.06 | Response cache: LRU + TTL, singleflight, tenant-scoped keys, stream replay (practice `go/02`, `python/05`) | `go/gateway/cache/` | gw.01, reading: ai-platform-engineering/04 | `Cache{Get(ctx, Key) (Entry, bool); Put(ctx, Key, Entry, ttl)}`; `KeyOf(p Principal, cfgRev string, r CanonicalRequest) Key`; only `temperature == 0` or a fixed `seed` | gw.01 chain | U (canonicalization: field order, defaults), F (100 concurrent identical requests make 1 upstream call; tenant A never reads tenant B; TTL expiry under a fake clock) | `X-TL-Cache: hit` ratio in the load report |
| gw.07 | Usage ledger, metering, admin API | `go/gateway/ledger/` | gw.01, lang.11 | `Ledger{Record(ctx, UsageRecord) error; Query(ctx, UsageFilter) ([]UsageRow, error)}`; `formats/usage.v1.sql`; `/admin/v1/*` | gw.01 chain and admin API, ag.04 `query_usage` tool (reads `formats/usage.v1.sql` tables) | I (ledger sum == engine-reported usage over 1k requests), F (SIGKILL the gateway: rows complete or absent, WAL mode) | `<system> usage --tenant acme --since 1h` |
| gw.08 | Usage policy enforcement (with ethics.05) | `go/gateway/policy/` | gw.01, reading: ethics.05 (head file, D33), data.05 (detector list, re-implemented in Go) | `Policy{Check(ctx, p Principal, r *InferenceRequest) (Decision, error)}`; `Decision{Allow bool; RuleID, Reason string}`; rules in `policy.v1.yaml` (model-card restrictions, `max_tokens` caps, classifier rule = engine `/v1/embeddings` + the exported linear head, D33) | gw.01 chain, audit log | C (policy fixture matrix; red-team fixture set blocked; `policy.v1.yaml` validates against `formats/policy.v1.schema.json`), E (the Go linear head scores fixture embeddings equal to the Python L6.5 scores within 1e-6), U (every deny audit-logged with the rule id; request logging redacts PII with the Go port of the data.05 detectors; an engine `/v1/embeddings` failure fails closed with 503) | 451 on a blocked prompt |

**MS-gateway.** `{gateway}` in front of `{engine}` (ports allocated by the runner): `ss conform openapi:v1 --target gateway` passes (auth, limits, cache, headers, `priority.internal`), failover before first byte works, and the usage ledger reconciles with engine usage. Cases that declare `requires = ["gw.08"]` (such as `policy.451`) report `pending` until gw.08 passes; the usage policy lands in Pass 10 and is checked by MS-agent.

Where saige and production gateways go further:

| Chapter | Pointer |
|---|---|
| gw.03 | saige shared `Budget` reserves request, token, and cost capacity under one lock and settles once; Redis GCRA, Envoy global rate limit |
| gw.04 | saige retry provider: buffer until the first content delta, then never retry (`drainUntilContentOrError`) |
| gw.05 | saige `provider/router`: routes select immutable model configurations, selection is sticky for prompt-cache affinity, failover only before commitment; llm-d and KServe KV-aware inference schedulers |
| gw.06 | saige: response cache, prompt cache, durable step record, and journal are separate contracts; identity is private by default; semantic caches |
| gw.08 | Llama Guard style classifiers; policy as code (OPA, Cedar) |

PR CI replaces the model with the `faketool` provider (4.4), a rule-based fake keyed on the last user or tool message, so learner-built prompts and tool schemas still match; the frontier provider is opt-in through an env var.

| dep.02 | kind cluster + local registry | `deploy/kind/cluster.yaml` | dep.01 | cluster `kind-<system>`, registry `localhost:5001`, `extraMounts` for `./artifacts`, `extraPortMappings` for 30080, 30090 (Prometheus), 30300 (Grafana), 30320 (Tempo), 30733 (durable, for a host-side worker); the cluster is recreated because port mappings are fixed at creation; nodes Ready, images pullable | `kind create cluster` |
| dep.03 | Helm charts for the gateway and the engine, plus the observability stack | `deploy/helm/<system>-{gateway,engine}`, `deploy/observability/Chart.lock` | dep.02, reading: systems/03 | `values.schema.json` from `contracts/helm/`; engine `role: unified|prefill|decode`; gateway 1 replica; PDBs. Policy test over `helm template`: probes, limits, non-root, no `:latest`, PDB present, **secrets only through `Secret` references** (the pepper and API keys; the values schema rejects literal secret values); `kubectl apply --dry-run=server` on kind; pinned upstream charts and the `PrometheusRule` selector from `contracts/helm/observability.md` | `helm upgrade --install` |
| dep.04 | Tilt dev loop | `deploy/Tiltfile` | dep.03 | resource deps (engine before gateway; durable before workers once dep.06 lands), live update for Go, rebuild for Rust; `tilt ci` exits 0 within budget | `tilt up` |
| dep.05 | CI for the learner repo (release workflow added by craft.11) | `.github/workflows/{ci,release}.yml` | craft.01, load.02 | jobs: lint, unit, `ss check --all --ci` through the supersource checkout at `contracts/VERSION` (5.13), image build, kind e2e (`tilt ci` + `ss milestone MS-prod --smoke`), load.02 perf gate on main; YAML parse check for required jobs | MS-prod |
| dep.06 | Durable and worker images and charts: WAL PVC, StatefulSet, KEDA autoscaling of workers | `deploy/docker/{durable,worker}.Dockerfile`, `deploy/helm/<system>-{durable,worker}` | dep.03, dur.04, dur.09 | the dep.01 and dep.03 policies; the worker image carries the Go worker and the Python env; durable StatefulSet with a PVC and `wal_max_bytes` set; KEDA `ScaledObject` on `tl.durable.task_queue.depth` (KEDA pinned in `Chart.lock`); a queue burst scales workers up and back down on kind | `{ctl} data build` on kind |
| dep.07 | Agent image and chart | `deploy/docker/agent.Dockerfile`, `deploy/helm/<system>-agent` | dep.06, ag.05 | the dep.01 and dep.03 policies; the agent worker on queue `agent`; the frontier key, if any, only from a `Secret` | `{agent}` on kind |

#### obs: observability (`systems/04-observability/`)

| ID | Title | Learner path | Prereqs | Contract and checks | Lights up at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| obs.00 | One trace: gateway to engine in Jaeger (tracer) | tracing setup in the gateway entry point (Go OTel SDK) and the engine's hand-written OTLP/HTTP JSON export (L10.0); no owned library units | gw.00, L10.0, dep.00 | `otlpsink` asserts `gateway.proxy` -> `POST /v1/completions` parentage for one request; on kind, the `trace` matcher finds it through the Jaeger query API | MS-P1 |
| obs.01 | Tracing for the serving path; owns `go/otelx` (tracer provider, HTTP and gRPC middleware, `traceparent` helpers) | `go/otelx/`, Rust `tracing-opentelemetry` setup (L10.7), `deploy/observability/collector.yaml` (collector feeding Tempo and Prometheus) | obs.00, L10.7, reading: systems/04 | `otel/semconv.md` span tree for a request through gateway to prefill and decode; W3C propagation across HTTP and gRPC. `go/otelx` is a build unit (Go course tests) | one trace from curl through `gateway.route`, `kv.transfer`, and `engine.decode` |
| obs.02 | Metrics and log correlation | `:9464/metrics` on every service, `deploy/observability/` | obs.01 | `promscrape`: names, types, buckets, labels match `otel/metrics.yaml`; cardinality under 1k tenants within the cap; JSON logs carry `trace_id`; correlation is `kubectl logs` plus a `trace_id` grep (no log backend) | `curl :9464/metrics` |
| obs.03 | SLOs and multi-window burn-rate alerts. Beat 2 defines error budgets and burn rate | `deploy/observability/{slo.yaml,rules/*.yaml}` | obs.02 | TTFT p95, TPOT p95, availability (2.11); the alert names fixed in `otel/slo.schema.json`; rules rendered for the `prod` profile (14.4x at 1h/5m, 6x at 6h/30m) and the `drill` profile (same ratios, windows compressed 12x); `promtool test rules` with course synthetic series: fires on fast burn, quiet on noise; SLO latency targets from the in-cluster calibration Job | MS-prod |
| obs.04 | Dashboards as code for the serving path | `deploy/observability/dashboards/*.json` | obs.02 | required panels: SLO status, TTFT/TPOT heatmaps, KV usage, per-tenant usage; every panel query references a contract metric | Grafana during a load run |
| obs.05 | Observability for the control plane: workflow and activity spans end to end, including the Python OTLP export of subprocess activities (dur.09, the D9 exception), queue and DLQ panels | `deploy/observability/dashboards/control-plane.json`, collector config for the worker pods | obs.01, dur.09, data.09, dep.06 | span tree for one `CorpusBuild` activity and for `{ctl} train` down to `train.step` (sampled 1/50); `TRACEPARENT` honored; panels for `tl.durable.task_queue.depth`, `tl.durable.dlq.size`, redeliveries | one trace from `{ctl} train` to `train.step` |

`obs.01` owns a library unit, so it is a `build` module with practice-style artifact checks on top; `go/otelx` is called by dur.04 (activity spans from `ActivityTask.trace_context`) and ag.03 (agent spans).

**MS-prod.** On kind (context from `system.toml`): Helm deploy of the gateway, the engine (unified, then prefill + 2 decode), and the observability stack; `ss conform openapi:v1 --target gateway --base {deploy.gateway_url}`; end-to-end serving traces present; contract metrics scraped; SLO rules loaded; the learner's loadgen meets the SLOs at the rate set by the in-cluster calibration; and drill `ops.01` (kill a decode worker) stays within the error budget. Durable and worker charts join in Pass 8 (dep.06, obs.05, checked by MS-durable on kind), the agent chart in Pass 10 (dep.07).

#### ops: maintenance and incident drills (`systems/05-incident-response-and-chaos/`)

Every drill requires `docs/postmortems/<date>-<drill>.md` (Summary, Impact, Timeline, Root cause, Detection, Resolution, Action items). `ss drill end` checks the system invariants and the postmortem structure; content is graded with a self rubric. Drill specs and injectors are in 5.10. Drills run with the `drill` SLO profile (compressed windows, 2.11) so burn alerts can fire within `within_s`.

| ID | `ss drill` name | Injection | Expected detection | Pass condition | Teaches | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ops.00 | `engine-crashloop` | `deploy-patch`: the engine Deployment's model dir points at `/missing` | **manual** (no Prometheus until Pass 7, so the drill has no `[detect]` block): pod CrashLoopBackOff, `/readyz` failing | rollout healthy; `docs/runbooks/engine-crashloop.md` with Symptoms, Diagnosis, Mitigation | first runbook, `kubectl` triage | P1 |
| ops.01 | `kill-decode` | delete a decode pod mid-load | fast-burn alert, gateway failover logs | error ratio back under budget in 2 min; in-flight streams end with an SSE error event, not truncation; KV blocks back to baseline; no spliced streams | chaos, gw.05 commit rule | P7 |
| ops.02 | `durable-kill9` | SIGKILL the durable pod in a loop during `CorpusBuild` | `tl.durable.redeliveries` spike | manifest hash equals the clean run; `effects` shows exactly once | dur.01 to dur.06 | P8 |
| ops.03 | `poison-task` | an activity panics on one shard | DLQ alert | learner fixes it, redrives, workflow completes | dur.03, runbooks | P8 |
| ops.04 | `kv-v2-migration` | course ships KV format v2 (`ss contracts sync --to kv/v2` on a branch); the learner implements it (craft.13) and rolls out with mixed prefill/decode versions | negotiation errors if done wrong | zero failed requests during the rolling upgrade under load; v1 readers refuse v2 cleanly; ADR written | interface migration (craft.13), L10.6, rt.04 | P11 |
| ops.05 | `api-v2-migration` | course publishes `openai-subset.v2.yaml` | contract tests | gateway serves v1 and v2; v1 responses carry `Deprecation` and `Sunset`; per-version usage in gw.07; both conformance suites pass | deprecation (craft.12, craft.14) | P11 |
| ops.06 | `dep-upgrade` | a branch bumps a dependency across a breaking major with the package manager (`cargo add <crate>@<major>` or `go get <module>@<major>`), never with a patch to learner code | CI red | upgrade lands with all module checks and MS-L10 green | dependency hygiene (craft.15) | P11 |
| ops.07 | `perf-regression` | in a **scratch copy** of the learner repo where the target unit (`sched.rs` or `matmul.c`) is replaced by the reference, about 20 commits are generated, one of which applies an existing perf mutant (lock contention, tiling disabled) | load.02 gate fails | learner names the exact commit with `git bisect run` over `{loadgen} compare` or `ss bench course --assert` | bisect, benchmarking (craft.16) | P11 |
| ops.08 | `data-incident` | one source declared PII-contaminated and license-revoked | ledger query | all derived shards purged via the data.08 ledger; retrain decision recorded; model card updated | ethics, lineage | P11 |
| ops.09 | `noisy-neighbor` | one tenant floods long prompts | per-tenant latency panel | other tenants' TTFT p95 within SLO after tuning TPM and tenant priority (carried to engines by `X-TL-Priority` and `PrefillRequest.priority`) | gw.03, L10.2 priority | P11 |
| ops.10 | `runaway-agent` | an agent task that loops tool calls | budget metric | budget stops it before dispatch; the durable run resumes after a budget grant | ag.03, ag.05 | P11 |
| ops.11 | `eventlog-disk-full` | `wal-quota`: lower `TL_DURABLE__WAL_MAX_BYTES` to just above current usage, then run a workflow burst until appends hit the quota (kind's local-path volumes do not enforce PVC capacity, so the quota is the contract) | `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` append errors, DLQ and queue-depth panels | no acked event lost; server refuses writes cleanly; raising the quota resumes every workflow | dur.01 | P11 |
| ops.12 | `raft-partition` (optional) | netem partition of the leader | leader change | acked appends survive; linearizability check passes | dur.10 | P11 |

**MS-ops.** Every core drill (`ops.01` to `ops.11`) passes `ss drill end` with a postmortem.

### 4.6 Practices: craftsmanship, testing, security, ethics, reviews, field, interviews

Practices apply to the learner's own system. Kinds: `practice` (artifact plus a check), `build` (code with tests), `proof`/rubric (self-graded in v1).

| ID | Title | Kind | Chapter home | Artifact or check | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| craft.01 | Your repo and CI gate (conventional commits enforced) | practice | `software-craftsmanship/08-code-review-and-ci/01-your-repo-and-ci-gate.md` | CI with three jobs: commit-message lint, native tests, and `ss check --all --ci` through a checkout of public supersource at `contracts/VERSION` (5.13 recipe; it checks nothing yet in Pass 0 and every started module from Pass 1); `git-log` and `ci-status` matchers | P0 |
| craft.02 | Architecture decision records | practice | `software-craftsmanship/06-documentation-writing/01-architecture-decision-records.md` | `docs/adr/0001-*.md` from the template; ADR section lint | P1 |
| craft.03 | TDD, unit tests, and how you are graded (rungs R0 to R3): includes the mutation-testing primer (what a mutant is, killed vs survived, how the score and required semantic mutants work) before the first mutation grade | practice | `software-craftsmanship/03-testing-mentality/` | `ss tdd red/green` journal; mutation grade on L0 modules | P2 |
| craft.04 | Property-based tests (R4) with Hypothesis, proptest, `rapid`, and `ss_prop.h` | practice | same | tokenizer roundtrip and pipeline idempotence properties; mutation grade | P3 |

| craft.06 | Benchmarks and perf gates (R7) | practice | same | benchmark + budget file; perf mutants must trip the gate | P6 |
| craft.07 | Mutation testing in depth: equivalent mutants, semantic mutants from pitfalls, reading survivors | practice | same | `ss mutate` over the learner's L3/L4 tests | P4 |
| craft.08 | Code review: review a seeded PR against your system | practice | `software-craftsmanship/08-code-review-and-ci/02-code-review.md` | the PR is built in a scratch copy where the target unit is the reference plus seeded defects (never a patch to learner code); review findings vs the seeded defect list | P7 |
| craft.09 | C4 diagrams in D2 | practice | `software-craftsmanship/05-diagramming-c4/` | `docs/c4/{context,containers,components-engine}.d2` render; every container in 2.1 appears | P11 |
| craft.10 | Runbooks and Diátaxis docs | practice | `software-craftsmanship/06-documentation-writing/` | runbook per required alert; README structure lint | P11 |
| craft.11 | Commits, semver, releases (`v1.0.0`) | practice | `software-craftsmanship/09-releases-and-deprecation/` | tagged release, changelog, release workflow | P11 |

| craft.13 | Interface migration: KV format v1 to v2 | **build** | `software-craftsmanship/10-maintenance/` | `upgrades` `c/src/runtime/kv_pool.c`, `c/src/kernels/paged_attn.c` (fp8 reads), `rust/crates/tl-engine/src/kv_transfer.rs`; contracts delivered by `ss contracts sync --to kv/v2`; tests: v2 envelope roundtrip, `parity/kv.wire.v2`, mixed-version negotiation; ADR + drill ops.04 | P11 |
| craft.14 | Interface migration: API v1 to v2 | **build** | same | `upgrades` `rust/crates/tl-serve/src/openai.rs`, `go/gateway/server/` (version routing), `go/gateway/ledger/` (per-version usage); contracts by `ss contracts sync --to api/v2`; `openapi:v1` and `openapi:v2` both pass; drill ops.05 | P11 |
| craft.15 | Dependency upgrades | practice | same | drill ops.06 | P11 |
| craft.16 | Perf regression bisect | practice | same | drill ops.07 | P11 |
| craft.17 | Threat model (STRIDE on your DFD) | practice | `software-craftsmanship/11-security/` | `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` with every trust boundary from 2.3, including the RAG-to-tools path | P11 |

| craft.21 | Resilience tests (R10) | practice | same | kill a worker mid-workflow and assert exactly once; the resilience mutants (idempotency key ignored, lease not renewed, fsync skipped) each fail the suite | P8 |
| craft.22 | Model evals as tests (R8) | practice | same | held-out loss and seeded quality score with a regression threshold; model mutants flagged at p < 0.05 over 5 seeds | P9 |
| craft.23 | Agent evals as tests (R9) | practice | same | suite with scorers, judge, and A/B; agent mutants detected with non-overlapping 95% CIs | P10 |
| ethics.01 | Data licensing and the ledger | practice | `responsible-ai/01-data-licensing/` | ledger schema and allowlist; pairs with data.08 | P3 |
| ethics.02 | Privacy and PII policy | practice | `responsible-ai/02-privacy-and-pii/` | PII policy doc; pairs with data.05 | P3 |
| ethics.03 | Datasheet and model card | practice | `responsible-ai/03-model-and-data-cards/` | `DATASHEET.md`, `MODEL_CARD.md` from templates (third-party models such as SmolLM2-135M-Instruct labelled as such); `ModelRelease` gate checks presence | P9 |
| ethics.04 | Bias and safety evals | build (Python) | `responsible-ai/04-bias-and-safety-evals/` | `tinyllm/eval/{safety,bias}.py`: templated bias probes with CIs, refusal and toxicity rates on fixture sets, ROC-AUC (M01.4, M07.7); call site: dur.12's release gate reads the safety rows that `EvalSuite` produces with `{tinyllm} eval --suite safety` | P9 |
| ethics.05 | Usage policy at the gateway | practice | `responsible-ai/05-usage-policy/` | `USAGE_POLICY.md`, `policy.v1.yaml`, a linear policy head trained with L6.5 over the engine's embeddings and exported per D33, wired into the gw.08 classifier rule; red-team fixture set blocked | P10 |
| ethics.06 | Professional responsibility and disclosure | proof (rubric) | `responsible-ai/06-professional-responsibility/` | written reflection graded by rubric | P11 |
| review.01 | Design review: tracer and serving platform | proof (rubric) | `systems/01-system-design/` | review doc against `rubrics/design-review.md` | P7 |

| review.03 | Design review: the whole system | proof (rubric) | same | same | P11 |
| field.01 to field.05 | Mock engagement against your platform: discovery, qualification and sizing, performance engagement, POC and evaluation, migration plan | practice | `field-engineering/08-mock-engagement/` | deliverables per stage, graded by rubric; sizing uses M05.1 and the learner's load reports | P11 |
| field.06 | Commercials and security review: answer a customer security questionnaire from your threat model and SBOM | practice | same (applies `field-engineering/06`) | completed questionnaire citing `THREAT_MODEL.md`, SBOMs, and the usage policy | P11 |
| field.07 | Escalation and handoff: hand the platform to a mock customer team using your runbooks | practice | same (applies `field-engineering/07`) | handoff doc and an escalation drill walked through the learner's runbooks | P11 |
| iv.01 | Defend your system | proof (rubric) | `interviews/defend-your-system/` | question bank answered against the learner's own design | P11 |

Competitive programming and `practice/` (predict, build, reattempt) are unchanged and off the course spine.

**Language and tool primers (D38).** Each primer is a `practice` module: a chapter plus small checked exercises in the learner repo's `primers/` (references in `course/ref/primers/`). Each sits immediately before the first module that needs it.

| ID | Primer | Exercises (checked by `ss check lang.NN`) | First use | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| lang.01 | Python and numpy: arrays, dtypes, broadcasting, views vs copies, `uv` projects | a broadcasting worksheet and a vectorized bigram count | L0.0, rt.01 loader, L0.1 | P0 |
| lang.02 | Shell, git, make, processes: exit codes, signals (SIGTERM, SIGKILL), environment, pipes | a `Makefile` for a two-file C program; a script that traps SIGTERM and exits 130 | craft.01, every `ss` verdict | P0 |
| lang.03 | C: memory, pointers, structs, the C11 toolchain, sanitizers, headers and linkage | the practice `c/01` dynamic-array drill (reference exists) plus a ctypes round trip | rt.01, M03.1 | P1 |
| lang.04 | Rust: ownership, traits, `Result`, cargo workspaces, `extern "C"`, std TCP | a line-protocol echo server on `std::net` | L10.0, ds.05, L1.5 | P1 |
| lang.05 | HTTP/1.1, JSON, and Server-Sent Events from the wire up | parse and emit an HTTP request and an SSE stream by hand; `curl -N` against it | L10.0, gw.00 | P1 |
| lang.06 | Go: packages, interfaces, goroutines, channels, `context`, `net/http`, `testing` | a streaming HTTP proxy with a deadline | gw.00, dur.01, load.01 | P1 |
| lang.07 | Containers and Kubernetes: images, layers, Pods, Deployments, Services, Helm, kind | build an image, deploy it to kind with a Helm chart, reach it through a NodePort | dep.00 | P1 |
| lang.08 | Python asyncio: event loop, tasks, cancellation, bounded concurrency | a bounded concurrent downloader against the `flakyhttp` fixture | data.01 | P3 |
| lang.09 | Async Rust and tokio: futures, tasks, channels, cancellation, hyper | an async SSE server with a bounded channel and disconnect handling | L10.5 | P7 |
| lang.10 | Protocol Buffers and gRPC: schema evolution, unary and streaming RPCs, generated stubs (Go and Rust) | a streaming gRPC service against the vendored stubs | L10.6, dur.01, dur.04 | P7 |
| lang.11 | SQL and SQLite: schema, transactions, WAL mode, indexes, aggregates | the usage-ledger queries over a fixture database | gw.07 | P7 |

### 4.7 Side quests

## 5. Testing ladder and harness

### 5.1 Summary

The course runs on `practice/bin/ss`, extended in place. The existing contract stays: **one committed source of truth per exercise, one command, the exit code is the verdict**. Additions:

| Addition | What it does |
|---|---|
| Course modules | addressed by id (`ss start L5.1`); each module owns whole source files of one growing system |
| Cumulative overlay | a check runs against the learner's own earlier modules; `--ref-deps` swaps in hidden references for unfinished dependencies and marks the verdict `assisted` |
| New verdict types | `solve` (SymPy-checked answers), mutation-graded learner tests, milestones run through the learner's own entry points, conformance and parity suites, drills against the learner's kind cluster |
| Ownership | `ss export` gives the learner a standalone repo with only their code, the contracts, and the vendored course tests |

`practice/` (predict, build, reattempt) and competitive programming do not change. The heavy lifting is a separate uv project, `course/harness` (`python -m sscourse`), so the root `uv.lock` stays unchanged.

### 5.2 Dispatch and markers

One branch is added before the existing `case "$sub"` in `practice/bin/ss`:

```bash
COURSE_ID_RE='^(M[0-9]{2}\.[0-9]{1,2}|L[0-9]{1,2}\.[0-9]|C[12]|S-M[0-9]{2}[a-z]?|(lang|ds|rt|data|dur|gw|ag|load|dep|obs|ops|craft|ethics|review|field|iv)\.[0-9]{2}|sq\.[a-z0-9-]+|MS-[A-Za-z0-9-]+)(\+cuda)?$'
course() { exec uv run --project "$ROOT/course/harness" --quiet python -m sscourse "$@"; }

case "$sub" in
  start|check|diff|show|reset|reveal|tests)
    [[ "${1:-}" =~ $COURSE_ID_RE || "${1:-}" == --all ]] && course "$sub" "$@" ;;

**Markers gain an optional id** so one reference tree holds every module, and in course references they **wrap whole function bodies only**:

```c
tl_status tl_matmul_f32(/* ... */) {
/* SOLUTION-BEGIN L9.1 */
  ...
/* SOLUTION-END */
}
```

1. `MARKER_RE="^[^A-Za-z0-9]*(${MARKER_BEGIN}( [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9.+-]*)?|${MARKER_END})[^A-Za-z0-9]*$"`.
2. `strip_solution` takes an optional `want` id: a region is stubbed only when its id is empty or equals `want`. For course files it writes a **body that compiles**, chosen by file extension and return type, instead of today's comment line: Python `raise NotImplementedError("L9.1")`; Rust `todo!("L9.1")`; Go `panic("todo: L9.1")`; C `tl_status` functions `return TL_EUNSUPPORTED;`, pointer returns `return NULL;`, other values `return 0;` (each after setting `tl_last_error` to `"unimplemented: L9.1"`), and `void` functions `abort();`. Practice exercises keep the existing comment stub. `ss verify course` lints that the fully stubbed reference tree compiles in all four languages and that markers sit only around function bodies.
3. **Ownership rule** (enforced by `ss verify course`): one unit (source file) belongs to exactly one module at a time, and every marker in it carries that module's id. A module with `upgrades = [unit]` takes the unit over; the current reference file then holds the later module's markers, and the earlier module's version is kept as a snapshot in `course/ref/history/<earlier-ID>/<unit>` with its own markers. Verify checks 2 and 5, and the earlier module's mutants, run against that snapshot.
4. **Upgrades in the learner repo.** `ss start` never overwrites an existing learner file. Starting an upgrading module prints the contract diff for each unit it takes over, and the learner edits their own file in place. From then on the earlier module's verdict is frozen as `pass (superseded by <ID>)`, its tests run as the later module's smoke regression, and a changed tree hash makes only the later module `stale`. This keeps the overlay file-granular with no merge logic.

### 5.4 Cumulative overlay and `--ref-deps`

**Resolution.** For `ss check L8.3`, `closure = transitive deps(L8.3)`. Each module in the closure gets a source:

| Condition | Source |
|---|---|
| it is `L8.3` | learner |
| learner has a fresh `pass` verdict (tree hash matches) | learner |
| not passing, no `--ref-deps` | **blocked**: exit 3, `L8.3 needs L8.2 (failing). Fix it, or rerun with --ref-deps` |
| not passing, `--ref-deps` | reference |
| `--ref-deps=all` | reference for every dep, even passing ones (isolates "my module or my deps?") |
| `--ref-deps=L8.2,rt.04` | reference for exactly those |

A verdict produced with any reference source is `assisted`. A milestone counts only when its closure is all learner-sourced; otherwise it is recorded as `assisted`. `--ref-deps` substitutes **library units only**; entry points are always the learner's (D16).

**Cumulative regression.** Before the module's tests, `ss check` reruns the `smoke` tests of every learner-sourced dep, so a change in `L8.3` that breaks `L8.2` reports `REGRESSION L8.2 (smoke: append_then_read)` and fails. `--no-cumulative` skips this.

**Which course tree runs.** Course tests, references, mutants, and fixtures are always taken from the supersource commit named in the learner's `contracts/VERSION`, through a cached git worktree (`~/.cache/supersource/worktrees/<sha>`), never from supersource HEAD. The harness code itself runs from HEAD. So a maintainer's contract edit cannot break existing learners or run new tests against old contracts; learners move forward with `ss contracts sync`.

**Per-language realization.** Substitution happens outside the learner repo, under `.ss/overlay/<ID>/`. Nothing from `course/ref` is copied into the learner repo. A unit outside the closure that the build still needs (a crate root's submodule, a C object a test links) gets the **stub** version of the reference (5.2), never nothing.

| Language | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Python | `tinyllm` and `corpus` are namespace packages (no `__init__.py`, lint-enforced). Tests run **in the learner's uv environment**: `uv run --project <learner>/python --with <harness test deps> pytest ...`, so the learner's own dependencies (`pyarrow`, `zstandard`, OpenTelemetry) are present. `PYTHONPATH=$TINYLLM_PYEXT_DIR:.ss/overlay/<ID>/subst/python:<learner>/python`, where `subst/` holds symlinks to the reference units only for reference-sourced modules. First hit per submodule wins, so imports inside reference units resolve to learner code for every other module: that is the cumulative property |
| C | explicit per-unit object selection, in **two builds**: (a) sanitized, `cc -std=c11 -O1 -g -fsanitize=address,undefined -I<learner>/contracts/c/include <one .c per unit: learner, ref, or stub> course/tests/<ID>/*.c -o .ss/build/<ID>/test-asan`, used only by the C harness; (b) unsanitized `-O2`, which builds `.ss/build/<ID>/libtinyllm.{a,dylib,so}` for ctypes, Rust, and benchmarks. Leaks are checked portably by the counting allocator (4.4) |
| Rust | a **copy farm** `.ss/overlay/<ID>/rust/` of the learner's `rust/` at file granularity, where each reference-sourced file is a copy of `course/ref/rust/...`. Files are copied, not symlinked (Cargo decides freshness by mtime through links): a file whose source or content hash changed since the last build is rewritten with a fresh mtime, and unchanged files keep theirs, so builds stay warm. The farm has its own generated `Cargo.toml` (the learner's manifests plus the `allowed-deps.toml` pins reference units need, plus the harness crate `ss-tests` whose `tests/<id_>.rs` come from `course/tests/rust/`) and its own `Cargo.lock` seeded from the learner's. `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=<learner>/.ss/target`, shared by every farm and every mutant run. The learner's manifests and lock are never touched |
| Go | a **copy farm** `.ss/overlay/<ID>/go/` of the learner's module with reference-sourced files copied in, a generated `go.mod`/`go.sum` (the learner's requirements plus the `allowed-deps.toml` pins reference files need), and `GOWORK=.ss/overlay/<ID>/go.work` = the farm + `contracts/go` (`supersource.urmzd.com/tl/contracts`, generated stubs included) + `course/tests/go` (`supersource.urmzd.com/tl/coursetests`). `go test -count=1 supersource.urmzd.com/tl/coursetests/<id_>/...`. `_test.go` files from the learner are never replaced |

| Env var set by `ss` | Value | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `TINYLLM_LIB` | `.ss/build/<ID>/libtinyllm.{dylib,so}` (the unsanitized build) | learner's ctypes loader (`rt.01`) |
| `TINYLLM_C_LIB_DIR` | same dir | learner's `tl-sys/build.rs` (contract: must honor it and emit `rerun-if-env-changed`) |
| `TINYLLM_PYEXT_DIR` | dir holding `tinyllm_rs.so` built from the farm's `tl-py` | **prepended** to `PYTHONPATH` |
| `PYO3_PYTHON` | the learner's uv interpreter | `tl-py` build (2.5) |
| `TINYLLM_FIXTURES` | the `course/fixtures` of the `contracts/VERSION` worktree | course tests |
| `TINYLLM_CACHE` | `~/.cache/supersource` | weight loaders, `ss fetch` |
| `SS_SEED`, `SS_MODULE`, `SS_OVERLAY` | `0`, id, overlay root | tests, debugging |

**Contract pre-check (exit 4).** `contracts/` is compared by **content hash** with `contracts/VERSION` (local edits fail: `contracts/ modified; revert, or run ss contracts sync`). Contracts carry a semver: a minor bump is backward compatible and `ss` only advises a sync; a major bump is a migration chapter. Then: the manifest entries required by 2.15 (lib targets, crate and module names, the contracts `replace`, the `tl-py` build contract); Python `mypy.stubtest` of each unit against `contracts/py`; C `cc -fsyntax-only` on each unit and an `nm` diff after Mach-O `_` normalization (no non-`static` symbol outside the headers); Rust `cargo check -p <crate>` in the farm (trait impls from `tl-contracts`); Go `go vet` plus a compile-only assertion file such as `var _ contracts.Queue = (*queue.Queue)(nil)`.

**Verdict ledger.** `.ss/verdicts.jsonl`, one line per check:

```json
{"id":"L8.3","kind":"build","tree":"sha256:9f..","sources":{"L8.2":"learner","rt.04":"ref"},"result":"pass",
 "mutation":{"score":0.84,"killed":21,"total":25,"required_ok":true},"ss":"a5a70b1","ts":"2026-10-08T14:02:11Z"}
```

`tree` hashes the module's owned units plus its graded tests; a changed hash makes the verdict `stale`. Verdicts are tagged `tainted` if supersource's own `course/` tree is dirty.

### 5.5 The `solve` kind

| File | Owner | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `course/solve/S-M03a/problems.md` | course | numbered problems q1..qN, also included in the chapter |
| `course/solve/S-M03a/key.toml` | course, hidden | typed expected answers, tolerances, reject canaries |
| `<learner>/solve/S-M03a.toml` | learner | answers as ASCII math |
| `<learner>/solve/S-M03a/q7.md` | learner | proofs |

```toml
# learner answers
[q1]  answer = "2*x*cos(x^2)"
[q2]  answer = "[1, 3) U (5, oo)"
[q5]  answer = "1/3"
[q6]  answer = "[[1],[1]]"          # an eigenvector
[q7]  proof  = "S-M03a/q7.md"

# key.toml
[q1]
type    = "expr"                    # expr | equation | number | interval | set | matrix | vector | basis | bool | choice | proof
expect  = "2*x*cos(x**2)"
vars    = { x = "real" }
check   = "either"                  # symbolic | numeric | either | both
domain  = { x = [-3.0, 3.0] }
samples = 32
rtol    = 1e-9
atol    = 1e-12
forbid  = ["Derivative", "Integral", "Limit"]
[[q1.reject]]  answer = "2*x*cos(x)"          # canary: must FAIL
[q5]
type = "number"
expect = "1/3"
exact = true                         # a Float in the answer fails: "give an exact value"
[q6]
type = "vector"
expect = "[[1],[1]]"
up_to = "scalar"                     # none | scalar | sign | column_sign | permutation
[q7]
type = "proof"
rubric = ["States the induction hypothesis for n = k", "Proves the base case explicitly",
          "Uses the hypothesis in the inductive step, not the conclusion", "Every symbol is defined before use"]
```

| Type | Equal when |
|---|---|
| `expr` | **symbolic**: `simplify(a - b) == 0` (also `expand`, `trigsimp`, `logcombine(force=True)` under declared assumptions); **numeric**: at `samples` seeded points in `domain`, at least 75% valid points and `abs(a-b) <= atol + rtol*abs(b)` at each; `forbid` walks the tree |
| `equation` | `(la-ra)/(lb-rb)` is a nonzero constant |
| `number` | `exact`: `nsimplify` equal and no `Float` node; else tolerance |
| `interval` | SymPy `Interval`/`Union` equality, endpoints compared as `expr` |
| `set` | `FiniteSet`: same size, elements matched one to one under `expr` rules |
| `matrix` / `vector` | same shape, elementwise `expr`, with `up_to` equivalences |
| `basis` | span equality: `rank(A) == rank(B) == rank([A|B])` |
| `bool` / `choice` | exact, case-insensitive |
| `proof` | self-graded rubric in v1: `ss check` prints each rubric line, the learner answers y/n, all must be y; verdict tagged `self`. Lean later takes the same key slot (`type = "lean"`) |

**Input safety.** Allowed characters `[A-Za-z0-9_+\-*/^().,\[\]{} =<>|]` only; reject any `__`, any `.` followed by a letter, and identifiers outside `vars` plus a function whitelist (`sin cos tan exp log sqrt pi E oo I Abs floor ceiling binomial factorial Sum`). Parsing runs in a subprocess with a 5 s timeout. Feedback never shows the expected answer (`q1 FAIL: differs at x=1.30`). `ss verify course` checks for every key that `expect` passes, every `reject` fails, and every key parses.

Pen and paper is the only thing `solve` covers. Math that becomes code is a `build` module with call sites.

### 5.6 Grading the learner's tests: mutation testing

**Principle: a test is graded by what it catches.** The learner's graded tests run against **our reference with one planted fault**, never against their own implementation, so the grade measures only the tests.

**Storage**: `course/mutants/<ID>/manifest.tsv` plus one `<mid>.patch` (unified diff against `course/ref`) per mutant:

```
# mid	unit	tier	operator	line	required	public	private
m001	rust/crates/tl-engine/src/block_manager.rs	auto	cmp_flip	88	n	comparison changed in free-list pop	< to <= in pop bound
s01	python/tinyllm/infer/paged.py	semantic	pitfall-2	-	y	(hidden until pass)	last partial block never allocated
```

- **Auto mutants** from `course/oracle/mutate.py`: Python `ast` operators, a small `go/ast` mutator, `cargo mutants --list --diff`, tree-sitter-c. Operators: comparison flip, boundary ±1, arithmetic swap, constant replacement, return default, condition negation, statement deletion, swapped arguments.
- **Semantic mutants**: hand-written, one per chapter Pitfall. The most valuable ones.
- **Pruning** (maintainer side): a mutant is committed only if it compiles, the course tests kill it, and it is not redundant (same killing test set as another). Target 15 to 40 per module. `ss verify course` re-checks that every patch applies and is still killed.

**Run** (`ss mutate`, also at the end of `ss check`):

1. Baseline A: learner tests pass against the unmutated reference (deps from the reference). On failure: `your test rejects a correct implementation: <name>`, score 0.
2. Baseline B: learner tests pass against the learner's implementation.
3. Budget: baseline within `time_budget_s`; each mutant times out at `max(2 s, 10 x baseline)`.
4. For each mutant, build the overlay with `ref + patch` and run only the graded test path. Rust and C mutant runs share the one warm `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` and object cache (only the mutated unit rebuilds); Python and Go run in parallel. Killed = nonzero exit or timeout (reported separately).
5. `score = killed / total`. Pass = `score >= threshold` and every `required` mutant killed.
6. Results cached by `(hash(learner test files), hash(ref unit), hash(patch))` in `.ss/cache/mutation.json`; the same key caches maintainer-side kill checks in CI.

**Cost control.** `ss check` runs the required mutants plus a seeded sample of up to 8 others and reports an estimate; the verdict records the full grade, which `ss mutate` computes once per learner-test hash and caches, so the full cost is paid only when the tests change. Mutants per module are capped at 40.

Survivors show the `public` text and location. Semantic survivors show only `a planted bug from Pitfall 2 survived` until the module passes or `--reveal-survivors` (which records `spoiled`).

**Black-box rule.** Graded tests touch only the contract: Python tests import only names in `contracts/py` (AST scan); Go tests are external `package <pkg>_test`; Rust graded tests are integration tests only; C tests include only `tinyllm/*.h` and `ss_test.h`.

| Rung (5.12) | Threshold | Required semantic mutants |
|---|---|---|
| R2 | 0.60 | none |
| R3 | 0.70 | 1 |
| R4 to R6 | 0.80 | all tagged |
| R7 to R10 | 0.90 for unit mutants; special mutant classes per 5.12 | all tagged |

`ss verify course` runs `course/ref/learner-tests/<ID>/` through the same pipeline to prove each bar is reachable.

### 5.7 Milestones against learner-supplied commands

**Spec**: `course/milestones/<MS-ID>.toml`.

```toml
id       = "MS-L8"
title    = "Your Python inference stack matches no-cache output token for token"
requires = ["L8.1", "L8.2", "L8.3", "L8.4", "L8.5", "L8.6"]
pass     = 6
ci       = "pr"

[[step]]
name    = "cache equivalence on the tiny model"
run     = "tinyllm"
smoke   = true
argv    = ["generate", "--model", "{asset:tiny-hf-models/tiny-llama-2l}", "--prompt-file", "{fixture:L7.9/margin-prompts.txt}",
           "--max-tokens", "32", "--greedy", "--cache", "{cache}", "--kv-dtype", "f16"]
matrix  = { cache = ["none", "contiguous", "paged"] }
expect  = { match = "tokens-equal", file = "course/fixtures/L7.9/tiny_greedy_32.json" }
timeout_s = 120

[[step]]
name    = "real SmolLM2-135M greedy matches HF"
ci      = "nightly"
run     = "tinyllm"
argv    = ["generate", "--model", "{asset:smollm2-135m}", "--prompt", "The capital of France is", "--max-tokens", "16", "--greedy"]
expect  = { match = "tokens-equal", file = "course/fixtures/L7.9/smollm2_greedy_16.json", near_tie = { logits = "tinyllm", margin = 1e-3 } }
```

| Matcher | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `exit-code` | default 0 |
| `exact` / `contains` / `regex` | stdout after `normalize` (same function as predict) |
| `json-last-line` | the last stdout line parses as a JSON object of named metrics, compared with thresholds (`>=`, `<=`, `ref*1.05`, `calibrated`: mean + 3 sd over 5 reference seeds from `ref-thresholds`) |
| `tokens-equal` | compares the `ids` array of the final JSON line (`spec/cli-roles.md`) with the expected ids; no tokenizer is involved. **Near-tie rule**: oracle files hold only prompts whose top-2 logit margin is at least 1e-3 at every step; when `near_tie` is set (for learner-trained models with no margin-filtered oracle), the harness reruns the learner's `{tinyllm} logits` under teacher forcing on the expected sequence, and a first divergence at a step whose margin is below `margin` is reported as `near-tie` instead of failing |
| `numeric` | floats from stdout with `rtol`/`atol` |
| `json-schema` | stdout validates against a schema |
| `file-produced` | a path glob exists and passes a sub-matcher (for example parquet row counts via pyarrow) |
| `suite` | a conformance suite against a started `service` |
| `promql` | an instant query against `[deploy].prometheus` meets a bound; `hold_s = N` re-evaluates it every 15 s and requires it to hold for N seconds |
| `trace` | a trace with the named span tree exists in `[deploy].traces` (Tempo or Jaeger query API) for the window |
| `git-log` | last N commits match Conventional Commits |
| `ci-status` | the latest learner CI run on the default branch concluded `success` (`gh run list --branch <default> --limit 1 --json conclusion`); without a GitHub remote, the `[ci].local` commands from `system.toml` exit 0 |
| `perf` | throughput or latency relative to `ss bench --calibrate`; `ci = "local"` only |

The runner first executes `[build].steps`, then starts services in dependency order (`after`), waits for `health`, runs steps, tears down, and logs to `.ss/milestones/<MS-ID>/<ts>/`. Placeholders:

| Placeholder | Value |
|---|---|
| `{fixture:<path>}`, `{asset:<id>/<path>}` | a committed fixture in the `contracts/VERSION` worktree; a fetched asset under `$TINYLLM_CACHE` (5.11) |
| `{out}` | a fresh per-run output directory; `{out:<step-name>}` is an earlier step's |
| `{ckpt}` | `{out}/ckpt/LATEST` resolved to the step directory it names |
| `{models}` | `$TINYLLM_CACHE/models` |
| `{port}`, `{health_port}`, `{grpc_port}`, `{kv_port}`, `{registry_port}` | free ports allocated per service instance (2.16); `{<service>.<port>}` from another entry |
| `{config}` | the generated `runtime.toml` for that instance |
| `{data}` | `{out}/<service>/data`, a per-instance state directory |
| `{queue}` | the step's `queue` field (default `default`) |
| `{model_dir}` | the step's `model_dir` field, or the artifact the previous step produced |
| `{<service>.api_base}` | `http://127.0.0.1:{<service>.port}/v1` |
| `{deploy.*}` | values from `[deploy]` |
| `{ctl}`, `{tinyllm}`, ... | the learner's `[entry]` roles |

**Smoke and kind steps.** A step marked `smoke = true` is rerun by every later pass gate. A step that needs a cluster is tagged `ci = "kind"`; in PR CI, pass gates run with `--smoke`, which reruns only the non-kind smoke steps as local processes (services started by the runner on allocated ports), and kind steps run in the kind jobs (5.14).

**Milestone catalog.** Pass gates `MS-P<n>` compose the part and component milestones of the pass and **rerun the `smoke` steps of every earlier pass gate**: that is the spiral invariant (7.2) made executable.

| Milestone | Pass | Pass condition (details in section 4) | CI |
|---|---|---|---|
| MS-P0 | P0 | `ci-status`: the learner's CI (commit lint, native tests, `ss check --all --ci`) is green on the first conventional commit; `lang.01` and `lang.02` exercises pass | pr |

Smoke steps (local processes): the same stream without kind | pr (smoke), kind job (full) |

| MS-L5, MS-L6, MS-L7 | P5 | transformer EM; post-LN divergence demo with pre-LN from L5.5; GPT/BERT/ELECTRA/LoRA; zoo report; SmolLM2 logits within 1e-3, greedy exact on margin-filtered prompts | pr (tiny, `--smoke`), nightly (SmolLM2, full) |
| MS-L8, MS-L9 | P6 | cache equivalence, quant budgets, spec decoding exactness; C backend token-identical; sanitizer-clean; speedups only in local perf steps | pr, local (perf) |
| MS-L10 | P7 | engine conformance, sampler parity on fixture logits, greedy Rust == Python, 64-way concurrency, abort, disaggregated subset, prompt-lookup spec, tool calls | pr (tiny model), nightly (SmolLM2-Instruct tool calls), local (perf) |

### 5.8 Conformance and parity

**OpenAPI suite.** `ss conform openapi:v1 --target engine|gateway [--base URL]` starts the matching `[services.*]` when no base is given. Every response is validated by `openapi-core`, plus behavioral cases in `course/conformance/openapi/cases/*.toml`. A case may declare `requires = ["<ID>"]`; until that module passes, the harness reports it `pending` instead of failing:

| Case | Tier | Asserts |
|---|---|---|
| `schema.models` | engine | `/v1/models` lists the served model |
| `chat.nonstream.greedy` | engine | temperature 0 output stable across 2 calls |
| `chat.stream.framing` | engine | `data: <json>\n\n`; first delta has `role`; final `data: [DONE]`; `text/event-stream` |
| `chat.stream.equals_nonstream` | engine | concatenated deltas equal the non-stream content at temperature 0 |
| `chat.finish.length` | engine | `max_tokens=4` gives `finish_reason: "length"` and `usage.completion_tokens == 4` |
| `chat.stop` | engine | stop sequence excluded, including across token boundaries; `finish_reason: "stop"` |
| `chat.usage` | engine | `prompt_tokens` equals the learner tokenizer's count of the templated prompt |
| `chat.seed` | engine | same seed, same output across two calls of the same engine (Rust-vs-Python seeded equality is proven on fixture logits by `parity/sampler`, never end to end) |
| `err.400`, `err.422` | engine | out-of-range and unsupported parameters in the error shape |
| `cancel.disconnect` | engine | client closes mid-stream; within 2 s `tl.engine.active_sequences` on `/metrics` drops and KV returns to baseline |
| `concurrency.16` | engine | 16 parallel streams complete; temperature 0 outputs equal the serial runs (batch-invariant kernels, 2.4) |
| `tools.call`, `tools.stream`, `tools.choice` | engine | `requires = ["L10.9"]`: schema-valid `tool_calls`, argument fragments streamed and reassembled, `tool_choice` forced and `none` |
| `priority.internal` | gateway | `X-TL-Priority` from a client is stripped; the gateway sets it from the key's tier toward the engine (recorded by a fake upstream) |
| `auth.401`, `auth.403` | gateway | missing, bad, or under-scoped key |
| `ratelimit.429` | gateway | burst over the limit gives 429 with `Retry-After` and `x-ratelimit-*` |
| `route.model` | gateway | `model` routes to the right upstream |
| `cache.hit` | gateway | identical temperature 0 request gives `X-TL-Cache: hit` |
| `policy.451` | gateway | `requires = ["gw.08"]`: fixture red-team prompt blocked |
| `client.openai_sdk` | both | the official `openai` Python client completes a chat and a stream |
| `v0.*`, `v2.*` | both | tracer cases; API v2 cases for `ops.05` (v1 and v2 side by side) |

**Parity.** The Python implementation is the specification. Parity holds through golden fixtures (every implementation vs the same oracle, so parity is transitive) and live differential fuzz where a binding exists.

| Suite (`course/conformance/parity/*.toml`) | Implementations | Mode | Equality |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tokenizer.bpe` | Python BPE (L1.2) vs Rust `tl-tok` via `tinyllm_rs` | golden (tiktoken GPT-2 ids, HF SmolLM2 ids) + live fuzz (Hypothesis text, 2k cases) | bit-exact ids |
| `rng` | Python (M06.3), C (M06.3), Rust (L10.1), Go (load.01) | first 1024 outputs for seeds `0, 1, 2^63`, plus `uniform_f64` and Box-Muller normals | bit-exact |
| `sampler` | Python L8.1 vs Rust L10.1 | the same fixture logits and seeds fed to both (never logits each side computed) | identical ids |
| `matmul` | C L9.1 vs numpy f64 | golden | `abs err <= 4 * eps32 * sqrt(K) * max(abs(A) @ abs(B))` |
| `softmax.online`, `flash.fwd` | C vs Python naive | golden | f32 rtol 1e-5, atol 1e-6 |
| `quant.int4`, `quant.fp8` | Python (M09.4, L8.5) vs C | golden | packed bytes and dequant values bit-exact |
| `kv.wire.v1`, `kv.wire.v2` (v2 from craft.13) | Rust writer vs Rust reader and C `tl_kv_import` | golden blobs in the 2.9 envelope | byte-exact roundtrip |
| `ring.hash` | Go ds.09 vs a Python reference map | golden key-to-node map | exact |
| `bloom` | Rust `tl-ds` vs `tinyllm_rs` | golden bit arrays | exact |

### 5.9 Test frameworks

`practice/` stays framework-free. The course uses idiomatic frameworks because the learner writes tests we grade and wires them into their own CI. `ss` still reduces every run to an exit code.

| Language | Course and learner tests | Property testing | Bench |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python | pytest | Hypothesis | pytest-benchmark (local) |
| Go | `testing` | `pgregory.net/rapid` | `testing.B` |
| Rust | `cargo test` | proptest | criterion (local) |
| C | `ss_test.h` (single header: `SS_TEST`, `SS_EQ`, `SS_CLOSE(a,b,rtol,atol)`, `SS_RUN_ALL()` returning the exit code) | `ss_prop.h` (seeded generators, shrink by halving) | `ss_bench.h` |

```bash
# what ss check executes (WT = the supersource worktree at contracts/VERSION, OV = .ss/overlay/<ID>)
PYTHONPATH="$TINYLLM_PYEXT_DIR:$OV/subst/python:$LEARNER/python" \
  uv run --project "$LEARNER/python" --with pytest --with pytest-randomly --with hypothesis --with "$ROOT/course/harness" \
  pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider -p randomly --randomly-seed="$SS_SEED" --hypothesis-profile=ss "$WT/course/tests/L5.1"
GOWORK=$OV/go.work go test -count=1 -race supersource.urmzd.com/tl/coursetests/dur_06/...
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=$LEARNER/.ss/target cargo test --manifest-path $OV/rust/Cargo.toml -p ss-tests --test l10_2 -- --test-threads=1
cc -std=c11 -O1 -g -fsanitize=address,undefined ... -o $BUILD/test-asan && $BUILD/test-asan    # counting allocator checks leaks
```

The harness's pytest plugin registers the Hypothesis profile `ss` (`derandomize=True`, `database=None`, `deadline=None`, `max_examples=100`), so property tests are reproducible and never write a local example database. Leak detection is the counting allocator on every platform (Apple clang ASan has no LeakSanitizer; `leaks --atExit` does not work on ASan binaries); Linux CI also sets `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1`. The fault and determinism kit is listed in 4.4.

### 5.10 `ss drill`: faults against the learner's kind deployment

**Safety gate.** A drill refuses to run unless `kubectl config current-context` equals `[deploy].kube_context`, that context starts with `kind-` or `k3d-`, and the namespace exists. Every action is limited to `[deploy].namespace`. Every injection writes its undo to `.ss/drills/<run>/journal.jsonl`; `ss drill reset` replays undos in reverse. There is no override flag.

```toml
# course/drills/kill-decode/drill.toml
id        = "ops.01"
title     = "A decode worker dies mid-stream"
requires  = ["MS-prod"]
seeded    = true                     # replica and timing chosen from --seed, revealed at `end`
time_limit_min = 45                  # enforced locally; CI uses the scripted responder instead
slo_profile = "drill"                # compressed burn-rate windows (2.11)

[[inject]]
kind   = "pod-kill"
target = "{deploy.services.decode}"
pick   = "random-ready-replica"
at     = "loadgen+30s"               # start the learner's loadgen at 20 rps, inject 30 s in

[detect]
alert    = "TTFTBudgetBurnFast"      # required name from otel/slo.schema.json; drills without [detect] are graded manually (ops.00)
within_s = 300

[[resolve.check]]
promql = "histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(gen_ai_server_time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le)) < 0.5"
hold_s = 300
[[resolve.check]]
promql = "sum(rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count{http_response_status_code=~\"5..\"}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[5m])) < 0.005"
hold_s = 120
[[resolve.check]]
suite  = "openapi:v1:gateway:smoke"

[postmortem]
path     = "docs/postmortems/{date}-kill-decode.md"
sections = ["Summary", "Impact", "Timeline", "Root cause", "Detection", "Resolution", "Action items"]
```

| Injector | Mechanism | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `pod-kill` | `kubectl delete pod --grace-period=0` | ops.01, ops.02, ops.12 |
| `deploy-patch` | patch a Deployment's env or args, undo restores it | ops.00, ops.11 (`wal-quota` lowers `TL_DURABLE__WAL_MAX_BYTES`) |
| `scale-zero` | `kubectl scale --replicas=0` | prefill pool outage variant |
| `resource-limit` | strategic-merge patch to limits | engine OOM loop variant |
| `netem` | ephemeral debug container with `NET_ADMIN` running `tc qdisc ... netem delay 300ms loss 5%` | KV transfer latency, ops.12 |
| `config-drift` | patch ConfigMap + rollout restart | bad routing table variant |
| `wal-quota` | `deploy-patch` of the WAL quota plus a workflow burst that fills it (local-path PVCs do not enforce capacity) | ops.11 |
| `clock-skew` | `POST /debug/clock` on the durable server started with `--test-clock` (2.7, owned by dur.07) | timer correctness variant |
| `activity-poison` | marks one shard so its activity panics | ops.03 |
| `tenant-flood` | loadgen profile for one tenant | ops.09 |
| `git-branch` | creates `drill/<name>` with a scripted commit series. Commits never patch learner-written code: ops.06 bumps with `cargo add`/`go get`; ops.07 and craft.08 build a **scratch copy** of the learner repo whose target unit is the reference plus an existing perf or seeded mutant; ops.08 changes only data and ledger rows | ops.06, ops.07, ops.08, craft.08 |
| `contract-bump` | `ss contracts sync --to kv/v2` or `api/v2` on a branch | ops.04, ops.05 |

`ss drill start <name> --seed N` injects and prints only a pager-style symptom. `ss drill status` shows elapsed time only. `ss drill end` reports: detected (when `[detect]` exists: the required alert fired within `within_s`, from the `ALERTS` series), TTD and TTM, resolved (all checks green, each held for its `hold_s`), trace evidence (a trace spanning gateway and engine exists for the window), and postmortem structure.

**Drills in CI.** The nightly `kind-e2e` job runs one drill by rotation against the reference system with a **scripted responder** (`course/drills/<name>/respond.sh`, the reference fix) and checks detection and resolution, not the time limit, so a drill fits the job budget. The `PrometheusRule` label selector the reference charts use is the one pinned in `contracts/helm/observability.md`, which the learner's rules must match too.

### 5.11 Determinism, fixtures, and calibration

| Variable `ss` exports | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS`, `MKL_NUM_THREADS`, `VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS`, `NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS` | `1` | BLAS reduction order changes with thread count |
| `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` | `1` (tests), unset for bench | same for Rust |
| `PYTHONHASHSEED` | `0` | dict and set iteration in tokenizer merges |
| `SS_SEED` | `0` (override `--seed`) | single seed source |
| `TZ`, `LC_ALL` | `UTC`, `C.UTF-8` | timestamps, collation |
| `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` | supersource HEAD commit time | reproducible artifacts |
| `GOFLAGS` | `-count=1` | the `ss` ledger is the cache |

| Rule | Enforced by |
|---|---|
| every randomized API takes an explicit `seed` or `rng`; no global RNG (`np.random.seed`, `np.random.<dist>(`, `random.random(`, `rand::thread_rng`, top-level `math/rand`, C `rand()`) | AST scan on learner units (L0.0 exemption until MS-P2) and refs |
| one cross-language RNG: PCG32 per `spec/pcg32.md` | `parity:rng` |
| greedy ties go to the lowest index | sampler tests |
| durable engine, gateway, loadgen take a `Clock`; no `time.Sleep` in tests | Go AST scan of `_test.go` |
| bit-exact where we define the algorithm (tokenizer, RNG, quant pack, sampling given RNG output, KV wire format); tolerance where floating point reorders | per-test `KIND` |
| tolerances: f64 rtol 1e-10/atol 1e-12; f32 1e-5/1e-6; bf16 1.6e-2/1e-3; reductions over K scale by `sqrt(K)`; tiny HF models atol 1e-5; SmolLM2 fp32 logits max abs 1e-3 with identical top-5 | `assert_close` in `tests/_lib/close.py`, `ss_test.h`, `tl-contracts::testing`, `contracts/go/testing` |

**Fixtures.** `course/oracle/` is a separate uv project with pinned `torch`, `transformers`, `safetensors`, `tiktoken`, `tokenizers`, `ml_dtypes`, `scipy`, `sklearn`, `sacrebleu`, `trl`; it is never imported by tests. Fixtures are `.npz` (`allow_pickle=False`, dtypes f32/f64/i32/i64/u8, `__meta__` JSON with seed, shapes, generator, upstream revision) or `.jsonl`. Budget: **at most 50 MiB committed, at most 8 MiB per file**, and a committed budget per authoring batch (section 9), all enforced. `course/fixtures/MANIFEST.tsv` records `path, sha256, bytes, generator, oracle_versions, upstream@revision, license`; every fixture id used in a milestone or test resolves to exactly one row. A PR that changes fixtures without a matching oracle or manifest change fails. A weekly `oracle-drift` job regenerates everything in a pinned container and compares **within tolerance** (the 5.11 tolerances for floats; exact equality only for integer outputs such as token ids and packed bytes), because torch CPU output varies with the runner's instruction set.

| Fixture (committed) | Generator | Contents | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ops-torch` | torch | fwd/bwd of 40 ops, CE, LN, RMSNorm, SDPA, MHA, LSTM, GRU, Transformer | about 4 MB |
| `optim-torch` | torch | SGD, AdamW, clip, schedule trajectories | < 1 MB |
| `tok-gpt2`, `tok-smollm2`, `tok-bert` | tiktoken, tokenizers | 300 strings each with ids, vocab/merges/`tokenizer.json`; 10k-string golden set | about 6 MB |
| `smollm2-parity` | transformers | last-position fp32 logits for 8 margin-filtered prompts, greedy 32-token outputs, param count | about 2 MB |
| `L7.9/margin-prompts.txt` and greedy id files | transformers | prompts whose top-2 margin is at least 1e-3 at every step for `tiny-llama-2l` and SmolLM2 | < 1 MB |
| `rope-scaling`, `lowp` | transformers, ml_dtypes | `inv_freq` + `attention_scaling` per kind; bf16/fp16/fp8 code tables, MX roundtrips | < 1 MB each |
| `small-corpora`, `configs` | scripts | tinyshakespeare (its byte `.bin` is derived by the harness at load), dates/add5 tasks, SST-2 2k, word-sim pairs, digits, `corpus/small.toml` sources; tiny model configs (`gpt-tiny`, `xfmr-small`, `llama-2m`) | about 3 MB |
| `stats`, `post` | scipy, sklearn, sacrebleu, trl | CI, permutation, McNemar, ROC/ECE, BLEU/chrF values; DPO and GRPO losses | < 1 MB |
| `dur/histories`, `agent`, `rag`, `eval` | reference runs | recorded histories of the course test workflows, `faketool` provider rules, agent suites, embeddings, judge labels, the prompt-injection suite | about 3 MB |
| `ref-thresholds` | hidden reference runs | mean and sd of `ref_metric` over 5 seeds per learning test and milestone | < 1 MB |

About 21 MB committed at design time, which leaves room for per-module fixtures (KV golden blobs, kernel goldens, recorded SSE streams).

**Large assets** (`course/fixtures/ASSETS.tsv`: url, revision, sha256, license) are never committed and are fetched by `ss fetch <asset>` into `$TINYLLM_CACHE`: `smollm2-135m` and `smollm2-135m-instruct` (`HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M` and `-Instruct` at pinned revisions), `tinystories` (full corpus for C1), `course-corpora` (the TinyStories 5 MB slice and its `ts-train.bin`, `ts-val.bin`, `ts-2m.bin` token streams, `wiki-mini`; about 20 MB), and `tiny-hf-models` (random tiny GPT2, BERT, ELECTRA, Llama variants including `tiny-llama-2l`, `tiny-llama-yarn`, `tiny-llama-3`, Mistral-SWA, DeepseekV3-MLA, Mixtral-MoE: safetensors + logits; about 8 MB). The last two are generated by `course/oracle/` and published as release assets of supersource. CI caches them by sha. Learners can also pull weights with their own `{tinyllm} pull`.

**Calibration.** `ss bench --calibrate` times the reference tiled matmul and decode loop on the current machine and stores the ratios; every local perf matcher is expressed relative to it (for example `learner_tokens_per_s >= 0.5 x ref`). For SLOs checked on kind, `ss bench --calibrate --in-cluster` runs the same benchmark as a Job in the learner's namespace (Linux, the kind VM's CPU and memory), and the SLO defaults scale from that number, not from the host.

### 5.12 The testing ladder

**Our tests are annotated exemplars.** Every course test carries a header; `ss verify course` rejects tests missing `WHY` or `KIND`.

```python
def test_top_p_keeps_the_crossing_token():
    # WHY: nucleus sampling keeps the smallest prefix of sorted probs whose mass
    #      reaches p, and that prefix INCLUDES the token that crosses p.
    # KIND: boundary
    # CATCHES: s03 (strict > in the cumulative check), m011
    # CHAPTER: L8.1 section 5, Pitfalls, item 2
    probs = np.array([0.5, 0.3, 0.2])
    kept = top_p_mask(probs, p=0.8)
    assert kept.tolist() == [True, True, False]
```

Course rule: every test catches at least one committed mutant or is tagged `smoke` or `regression`. Nightly verify proves each `CATCHES` claim by running that test alone.

| Rung | Starts at | Course provides | Learner writes | Graded by | Craft module |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R0 Read | tracer, L0 | full annotated suite | nothing | course tests pass | craft.03 (and craft.01 for the tracer) |
| R1 Fill the oracle | L0.3+, math | tests with `expected = ...  # TODO: compute by hand` holes | expected values by hand | hole-filled test passes against ref and their impl; values checked against hidden values | craft.03 |
| R2 Name-given cases | L1, ds | test names and docstrings, empty bodies | bodies | mutation 0.60 | craft.03 |
| R3 Red then green | L2, L3, ds | interface and one test | tests first (`ss tdd red`), then code | mutation 0.70 + 1 semantic; red-before-green journal | craft.03 |
| R4 Properties | L1.5, L3, dur, ds | properties in prose | Hypothesis / proptest / rapid / `ss_prop.h` | mutation 0.80, all semantic | craft.04 |
| R5 Oracles and gradcheck | L4 to L7 | fixtures, their own `gradcheck` (graded tests may use it; course tests never do, D35) | differential tests and gradchecks for every backward | mutation 0.80; must kill the "transposed grad" mutant | craft.05 |
| R6 Contract tests | gw, ag, L10 (P7) | OpenAPI spec | consumer-driven contract tests for gateway to engine | mutation 0.80 on gateway units | craft.20 |
| R7 Benchmarks and perf gates | L9, L10 | `ss_bench.h`, criterion, `testing.B` | benchmark + CI regression gate with a budget file | **perf mutants** (2x slowdown: loop order swap, tiling disabled) must trip the gate; 0.90 | craft.06 |
| R8 Model evals | C1, L11 (P9), L12 | held-out split, judge prompt | eval suite: held-out loss, seeded quality score, regression threshold | **model mutants** (wrong RoPE base, one layer zeroed, tokenizer off by one merge) flagged at p < 0.05 over 5 seeds | craft.22 |
| R9 Agent evals | ag (P10) | saige-style scorer interfaces | suite with scorers, LLM judge, A/B | **agent mutants** (tool description removed, retrieval disabled, system prompt truncated) detected with non-overlapping 95% CIs | craft.23 |
| R10 Resilience tests | dur (P8), ops | fault injectors as a library | kill a worker mid-workflow and assert exactly once; partition the Raft leader and check linearizability (optional with dur.10) | **resilience mutants** (idempotency key ignored, lease not renewed, fsync skipped) each fail the suite | craft.21 |

`ss tdd red <ID>` runs the learner's graded tests against their current units and **requires failure**, recording `(test hash, unit hash, ts)`. `ss tdd green <ID>` requires a pass with the same test hash. From R3 on, `ss check` requires a red record per test file that predates its green.

### 5.13 `ss export`

```
ss export ~/src/forge --remote git@github.com:me/forge.git
```

1. Refuses on a dirty learner tree.
2. `git clone --no-hardlinks` of the learner repo, keeping history (their conventional commits are part of the deliverable).
3. Vendors course tests and fixtures for every passing module into `third_party/supersource/tests/<ID>/` and `third_party/supersource/fixtures/`, plus the frozen helpers (`tests/_lib`), `third_party/supersource/{VERSION,LICENSE,NOTICE}` (Apache-2.0 attribution, supersource sha) and `ASSETS.tsv` for large assets. It also writes the minimum **glue** for the vendored tests to run natively: `third_party/supersource/go.work` (the learner module, `contracts/go`, the vendored Go tests), an `ss-tests` crate whose manifest adds it to a workspace file under `third_party/supersource/rust/`, and a `conftest.py` that sets `TINYLLM_FIXTURES` and registers the Hypothesis profile. The glue is test wiring, not a runner or CI.
4. Excludes `course/ref`, `course/mutants`, solve keys, `.ss/`, and reference entry points. Nothing from the reference ever lived in the learner repo, so there is nothing to scrub.
5. Writes `third_party/supersource/STATUS.md`: per module `pass`, `assisted`, `spoiled`, `self`, or `incomplete`, mutation scores, milestones earned. Fails on `incomplete` unless `--allow-incomplete`.
6. Prints the native commands that run the vendored tests in each language. It writes no runner and no CI file; wiring them into CI is `dep.05`.

**Learner CI before export (craft.01 recipe).** The learner's repo lives in `.scratchpad/course/` (or `SS_COURSE_HOME`) and is pushed to its own remote, where supersource is not present. Its CI checks out public supersource at the sha in `contracts/VERSION` into `.ss/supersource` and runs `SS_COURSE_HOME=$PWD .ss/supersource/practice/bin/ss check --all --ci`. `--ci` never uses `--ref-deps`. In Pass 0 there are no started modules and the step is trivially green; from Pass 1 it checks every started module.

### 5.14 Verification and CI

**`ss verify course` (per module):**

| # | Check | Fails when |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | reference builds and passes course tests | any test fails |
| 2 | **stub must fail**: reference with this module's regions stubbed (compiling bodies, 5.2) fails the course tests; for a unit later taken over by `upgrades`, against the `course/ref/history/<ID>/` snapshot | tests pass on a stub, or the stubbed tree does not compile |
| 3 | determinism | `determinism_runs` with shuffled order (`--randomly-seed` 0 and 1, `go test -shuffle=on`) disagree |
| 4 | contracts | `stubtest` refs vs `.pyi`; headers compile standalone with `-std=c11 -pedantic -Werror`; `tl-contracts`, `tl-proto`, and `contracts/go` build; generated proto code matches the `.proto` files; `openapi-spec-validator`; `buf lint`; every `formats/*.schema.json` validates its examples |
| 5 | markers | ownership rule (5.2); every unit in `units` has markers for this id; markers wrap whole function bodies only |
| 6 | mutants | every patch applies and is killed; reference learner tests reach the threshold |
| 7 | solve keys | `expect` passes, every reject fails |
| 8 | chapter contract | `ss lint` passes for the chapter (6.5) |
| 9 | call site | `kind = "build"` has a `used_by` entry that is a module, not a milestone or side quest (a milestone reference does not count) |
| 10 | test annotations | `WHY` and `KIND` present; `CATCHES` ids exist; course tests import assertion, gradcheck, and RNG helpers only from the frozen helpers (D35) |
| 11 | paths | `ss learn --verify`, including the check column and stage order (a module appears after every dep within its pass) |
| 12 | fixtures | manifest hashes, per-file and per-batch size budgets, every referenced fixture id resolves |
| 13 | registry | the 3.4 invariants: mirror rule for `deps`/`used_by`, pass order of deps, `reading`, and call sites, `upgrades` call-site inheritance |
| 14 | seams | an AST lint over every reference unit rejects references to another unit's names that the contract does not declare, and each reference unit compiles against stubbed neighbours (2.15) |

`--changed <ref>` maps changed files to module ids through `units`, `tests.dir`, fixtures, mutants, and solve dirs. In PR CI it fully verifies the changed modules and runs only the **smoke tests of their reverse dependents**; full reverse-dependent verification runs nightly. Mutant kill checks are cached by `(ref unit hash, test hash, patch hash)`, so an unchanged mutant is never re-run.

**CI matrix:**

| Job | Trigger | Runner | Budget | Runs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lint` | PR | ubuntu | 3 min | ruff, `gofmt -l`, `cargo fmt --check`, `clang-format --dry-run` on `course/`; `ss lint` |

### 5.15 `path.tsv` check column and `ss learn`

`path.tsv` gains an optional fifth column, `check`. Rows with four columns stay manual.

```
# stage	title	files	done when	check
3	Matmul and the C ABI	math/03-linear-algebra/01-vectors-matrices-and-matmul-in-c.md	Your tl_matmul_f32 matches numpy and Python calls it through ctypes.	module:M03.1
12	Inference milestone	paths/course-p06-inference-and-kernels/milestone.md	Your stack matches no-cache output token for token.	milestone:MS-L8
4	Chain rule by hand	math/01-calculus-1/README.md	You differentiate compositions without a table.	solve:S-M01
30	Decode worker dies	systems/05-incident-response-and-chaos/02-chaos-catalog.md	You detect within 5 minutes and restore the SLO.	drill:ops.01
```

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| accepted `check` values | `module:<ID>`, `solve:<ID>`, `milestone:<ID>`, `drill:<ID>`, `conform:<suite>`, `all:<ID>,<ID>`, `-` |
| `expand_rows` | reads five fields (today the fourth variable would swallow a fifth column); emits six columns, owner first |
| `learn_mark --done` | with `check` set, reads the fresh verdict from the ledger, runs the check when none exists, and marks the stage only on pass; `--force` marks anyway and appends to `<path>.done.log`; the `.done` format is unchanged |
| `learn_verify` | every `check` id resolves to a module, milestone, drill, or suite |
| `learn_stages` | shows `[x]`, `[~]` (assisted, self-graded, or forced), or `[ ]` |

### 5.16 Changes to existing files

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `practice/bin/ss` | course dispatch (5.2, including the `bench` routing that keeps `ss bench [lang]`); `MARKER_RE` and `strip_solution(want)` with per-language compiling stubs for course files; `expand_rows`, `learn_mark`, `learn_verify`, `learn_stages` for the check column; `verify course` special case before `fan_out`'s `valid_kind`; usage block lists the course verbs |
| `practice/README.md` | one section, "Course modules", pointing to `course/README.md` |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | PR jobs from 5.14; new `nightly.yml` and `oracle-drift.yml` |
| `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock` | unchanged (harness and oracle are separate uv projects) |
| `.gitignore` | `.scratchpad/` already covers the default learner home |

## 6. Pedagogy and the chapter template

### 6.1 Principles of the content

- **Every chapter answers "why now?" in terms of the learner's running system.** The motivating failure is a concrete symptom in a named component as it stands today.
- **First principles, every symbol defined.** Beat 2 has a symbol table whenever the chapter contains math.
- **The worked example reappears as a test.** The beat 3 numbers are the first case in the beat 4 test table, so the learner and the test agree on the definition before any code.
- **Pitfalls are tests.** Each pitfall row names the course test that catches it and the semantic mutant that plants it.
- **Nothing left on its own.** Beat 6 links back (prerequisites) and forward (call sites) by module id; `ss lint` enforces that every `deps` id appears as Back and every `used_by` id as Forward.
- **Textbooks become optional depth.** The card's "Optional depth" row replaces the old "primary reference" framing.
- **Going further.** Every build chapter ends with where production systems (saige, Temporal, vLLM, SGLang, llama.cpp, FlashAttention, HF tokenizers, datatrove, Envoy) go beyond the learner's piece.

### 6.2 Build chapter skeleton

````markdown
<!-- ss:module M09.2 -->
# Stable numerics: logsumexp, softmax, compensated sums

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Module** | `M09.2` · build · Python · Pass 2 · 2 to 3 h |
| **You build** | `python/tinyllm/num/stable.py`: `logsumexp`, `softmax`, `log_softmax`, `kahan_sum`, `pairwise_sum` |
| **Contract** | [`course/contracts/py/tinyllm/num/stable.pyi`](../../course/contracts/py/tinyllm/num/stable.pyi) |
| **Tests** | `course/tests/M09.2/` (what they check: section 4) |
| **Needs** | [`M09.1` IEEE 754](01-ieee-754.md), [`M02.1` Taylor series](../02-calculus-2/01-taylor-series.md) (or `--ref-deps`) |
| **Used by** | `L0.2` op library · `L0.3` fused cross-entropy · `L8.1` sampler · `L9.2` online softmax in C |
| **Milestone** | [MS-L0](../../paths/course-p02-foundations/milestone.md) |
| **Optional depth** | Higham, *Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms*, ch. 1 and 4 |

## Key Takeaways

- 3 to 5 bullets, each a claim the tests prove.

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start M09.2              # stubs into your repo, contract alongside
ss tests M09.2              # read the test catalog first
ss check M09.2              # exit code is the verdict
ss check M09.2 --ref-deps   # only if you skipped a prerequisite
ss diff  M09.2              # after passing: your code against the reference
```

---

## 1. Why now

One paragraph: the concrete failure in the system as it stands today that this
module fixes or unlocks. Name the component and the symptom.

## 2. Principles

Derived from first principles, in order. Every symbol is defined before use.

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $x \in \mathbb{R}^V$ | logits for one position | `float32[V]` |
| $m = \max_i x_i$ | shift that prevents overflow | scalar |

## 3. Worked example by hand

Numbers small enough to check on paper (V = 3), every intermediate written out.
The same numbers are the first test case in section 4.

## 4. The interface

```python
def logsumexp(x: np.ndarray, axis: int = -1, keepdims: bool = False) -> np.ndarray: ...
def softmax(x: np.ndarray, axis: int = -1) -> np.ndarray: ...
def log_softmax(x: np.ndarray, axis: int = -1) -> np.ndarray: ...
```

### What the tests check

| Test | KIND | Checks | Why it matters downstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test_hand_example` | unit | the section 3 numbers to 1e-7 | you and the test agree on the definition |
| `test_shift_invariance` | property | `softmax(x + c) == softmax(x)` | lets the C kernel subtract a running max (`L9.2`) |
| `test_no_overflow` | boundary | `x = [1000, 1000]` gives `[0.5, 0.5]` | large logits after training |
| `test_fully_masked_row` | boundary | all `-inf` gives zeros, not NaN | causal masks in `L5.2` |

## 5. Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Caught by |
|---|---|---|
| exponentiating before subtracting the max | `inf/inf = nan` at logit 89 in fp32 | `test_no_overflow` (mutant `s01`) |

## 6. Where it's used next

| Direction | Module | How it uses this |
|---|---|---|
| Back | `M09.1` | why fp32 overflows at 88.7 |
| Forward | `L0.3` | fused cross-entropy via `log_softmax` |
| Forward | `L9.2` | the same math in one pass, in C |

If you skip this module, `ss check L0.3` fails with
`needs M09.2: build it, or pass --ref-deps`.

## Going further

| Your piece | Production equivalent | What it adds | Where to look |
|---|---|---|---|
| `softmax` | PyTorch `torch.softmax` | fused kernels, autocast | `aten/src/ATen/native/SoftMax.cpp` |

## Company Relevance   <!-- optional, kept from house style when it adds signal -->
````

### 6.3 Mapping from the house style

| House style (existing topic READMEs) | Chapter template |
|---|---|
| `## Overview` (primary reference, prerequisites, time) | `## Overview` becomes the **module card**; textbooks move to "Optional depth" |
| `## Key Takeaways` | unchanged |
| `## How to Study` | `## How to work this chapter` (the `ss` verbs) |
| `# Concepts & Techniques`, `## Core Insight`, numbered sections | beats 1 to 5 |
| Technique Catalog | beat 4 tests table + beat 5 pitfalls table |
| `## Connections to Other Tracks` | `## 6. Where it's used next` (by module id) |
| `## Company Relevance` | optional, last |
| (new) | `## Going further` |

Topic READMEs stay as topic intros in house style and gain a `## Chapters` table (`# | Module | Chapter | Kind | Pass`) generated by `ss lint --fix-index`. Their survey sections remain as optional depth; content duplicated by a chapter is cut to a pointer (section 8).

### 6.4 Kind variants (differences from the build skeleton)

| Kind | Beat 3 | Beat 4 becomes | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `build` | worked example by hand | signature + tests table | `ss check <id>` |
| `solve` | a worked solution of one problem | **problem set**: numbered problems and answer format (`solve/<S-ID>.toml`) | `ss check <S-ID>` (SymPy) |
| `proof` | a fully written model proof of a sibling claim | **claim + rubric** from `course/rubrics/` | `ss check <id>` records a self-grade (`self`) |
| `practice` (primers, craft, deploy, observe, docs, ethics) | a worked artifact (for example a filled ADR for a different decision) | **the artifact and its check**: path, required sections, lint | `ss check <id>` runs the artifact check (`helm lint`, ADR lint, SBOM present, ...) |
| `drill` | a worked incident timeline | **inject, detect, mitigate, verify** | `ss drill start/end` |
| milestone page (`paths/course-pNN-*/milestone.md`; not a module kind) | a demo transcript | **entry roles you must declare** in `system.toml` + the steps | `ss milestone <MS-ID>` |
| `side` | as build | as build | `ss check <id>`; beat 6 says "no call site" and why it is still worth doing |

### 6.5 Link and lint rules (`ss lint`)

| Link | Mechanism | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| chapter to module | `<!-- ss:module <id> -->` on line 1 | id exists; card fields equal the registry |
| chapter to contract | card link to `course/contracts/...` | file exists; contract header comment `chapter: <path>` points back |
| chapter to tests | card path + beat 4 table | every test named in beat 4 exists in `course/tests/<id>/`, and every test there is named |
| chapter to milestone | card link | the milestone exercises the id |
| back and forward | beat 6 table | every `deps` id appears as Back, every `used_by` id as Forward |
| pitfalls to tests | "Caught by" column | named test exists; named mutant exists |
| going further | section | non-empty for every `build` |
| style | whole file | six `## N.` headings in order; symbol table in beat 2 when `$` appears; no U+2014 |

### 6.6 Going-further anchors by layer

| Layer | North star | Example pointers |
|---|---|---|
| `ag.*` | saige | `agent/agent.go` loop, `agent/tool_policy.go`, `agent/tree/compact.go`, `eval/judge.go`, `eval/experiment.go`, `rag/internal/pipeline/pipeline.go` |
| `dur.*` | Temporal | history events and replay, sticky task queues, `GetVersion`, Continue-As-New, visibility store |
| L8, L10 | vLLM, SGLang, llama.cpp | PagedAttention block manager, RadixAttention, `llama_batch` |
| L9 | FlashAttention, ggml | FA2 tiling and backward, `ggml-quants.c` Q4_0 |
| L1 | HF tokenizers, tiktoken | Rust BPE merges, regex pre-tokenizer |
| `data.*` | datatrove, Dolma | MinHash dedup stages, PII pipelines |
| `gw.*` | Envoy AI Gateway, LiteLLM, llm-d | rate-limit service, provider fallbacks, KV-aware scheduling |
| `dep.*`, `obs.*`, `ops.*` | production Kubernetes | Gateway API, KEDA, OTel Collector pipelines, Sloth/OpenSLO |

### 7.2 The spiral invariant

**After every pass, the learner's own system runs end to end and `ss milestone MS-P<n>` passes against their own code.** Every later module either upgrades a component **behind an unchanged contract** (declared with `upgrades`) or changes a contract through an explicit migration chapter. Pass gates rerun the smoke steps of every earlier gate, so the invariant is checked, not hoped for.

| Pass | Path | Weeks at 10 to 12 h | System after the pass (all learner-built) | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | course-p00-setup | 1.5 | Python/numpy and shell/git/make primers; empty repo from `ss course init`; CI runs commit lint, native tests, and `ss check --all --ci` on every push | MS-P0 |
| P1 | course-p01-tracer | 5 | C, Rust, HTTP/SSE, Go, and container primers; Python byte-level bigram (logits via their C matmul through ctypes), safetensors, Rust std-only engine streaming SSE with hand-written OTLP, Go gateway with a key check, kind + Helm + Jaeger, one trace, one drill, ADR-0001 | MS-P1 |
| P2 | course-p02-foundations | 7.5 | the bigram retrained by **their autograd** (L0.5 takes over `bigram.py`), gradcheck everywhere, the token-stream reader; the engine unchanged (same checkpoint contract) | MS-P2 = MS-L0 |
| P3 | course-p03-tokens-and-data | 7.5 | corpus pipeline v1 with ledger and decontamination, BPE, WordPiece, and Unigram in Python, BPE in Rust, n-gram/NPLM/word2vec run through `{tinyllm}`; the engine keeps serving the bigram | MS-P3 = MS-L1 + MS-corpus + MS-L2 |
| P4 | course-p04-sequence-models | 4 | RNN/LSTM/GRU LMs, seq2seq with attention, beam search in the CLI | MS-P4 = MS-L3 + MS-L4 |
| P5 | course-p05-transformer | 6 | transformer, GPT/BERT/ELECTRA/LoRA, the model zoo, modern block; SmolLM2-135M loads and matches HF | MS-P5 = MS-L5 + MS-L6 + MS-L7 |
| P6 | course-p06-inference-and-kernels | 7 | Python inference stack (sampler, KV, paged KV over their C pool, prefix cache in Rust, quant, spec decoding, constrained decoding) and batch-invariant C kernels behind `--backend c` | MS-P6 = MS-L8 + MS-L9 |
| P7 | course-p07-serving-platform | 8 | async Rust, gRPC, and SQL primers; Rust engine on their C kernels (continuous batching, chunked prefill, disaggregation, speculative decoding, tool calls), gateway (auth, limits, routing, cascades, cache, ledger), loadgen, gateway and engine charts, Tilt, Prometheus, Tempo, Grafana, SLOs | MS-P7 = MS-L10 + MS-gateway + MS-prod |
| P8 | course-p08-durable | 4.5 | data pipeline and training run as workflows (`CorpusBuild`, `TrainRun`, `EvalSuite`) on their durable engine; durable and worker charts with KEDA; control-plane traces | MS-P8 = MS-durable |
| P9 | course-p09-capstone-training | 5 | about 10M model trained on TinyStories (mixed precision, accumulation, resume) with core ablations and the zoo table, safety evals, released through `ModelRelease`, and served | MS-P9 = MS-L11 + MS-C1 |
| P10 | course-p10-agents | 5 | Go agent SDK on their engine's tool calls, RAG over their docs, eval runner with judge and A/B, usage policy at the gateway, agent chart; optional post-training | MS-P10 = MS-agent (+ optional MS-C2) |
| P11 | course-p11-operate | 5.5 | `v1.0.0`: migrations (KV v2, API v2 as build modules), upgrades, bisect, chaos, security, docs, reviews, mock engagement, defense | MS-P11 (includes MS-ops) |

About 67 weeks part-time. These are planning estimates: advance on gates, not elapsed weeks.

### 7.3 Stable contracts and their upgrade sequence

| Contract | Path through the course |
|---|---|
| model behind the checkpoint contract (`forward(ids) -> logits`) | count bigram (P1), autograd bigram (P2): both served by the engine. NPLM (P3), RNN/LSTM (P4), GPT, BERT, ELECTRA, the modern block, SmolLM2 (P5) run through `{tinyllm}` and the L6.7 zoo only (D36). From P7 the engine serves the Llama family (SmolLM2, the capstone 10M in P9, optional SFT chat in P10) and keeps `tl_arch = bigram` (D32) |
| `Tokenizer` | bytes (P1, D32), char, Python BPE, WordPiece, Unigram, Rust `tl-tok` via PyO3 (P3), chat template and tool-call parsing (P7) |
| `tl_matmul_f32` | naive `M03.1` (P1), tiled + packed + batch-invariant `L9.1` (P6): same symbol and signature, bench gate |
| checkpoint (`model.safetensors` + `config.json`) | F32 tensors only, `tl_format: 0` (P1), full dtypes and `tl_format: 1` with optimizer state and the token cursor (P2), quantized dtypes (P6) |
| HTTP `openai-subset` | v0 `/v1/completions` SSE (P1), v1 with chat, usage, stop, errors, tools on engine and gateway (P7), v2 migration (P11, craft.14) |
| KV layout | contiguous (P6), paged v1 (P6), v2 fp8 migration (P11, craft.13) |
| gateway handler chain | proxy (P1), auth, limits, routing, cache, ledger (P7), policy (P10) |
| Helm | engine and gateway charts plus Jaeger (P1), gateway and engine charts per role + observability (P7, dep.03), durable + workers + KEDA (P8, dep.06), agent (P10, dep.07) |
| `train` and `data build` | local process (P1 to P7), durable workflow (P8) |
| tracer engine (`tl-serve` v0, `tl-sys` v0) | std-only HTTP and hand-written OTLP (P1), tokio/hyper + full engine (P7) |

Solve-only modules and optional math (`M02.4`, `M09.7`, `M11.3`) remain reachable from their topic READMEs. `ss learn --verify` enforces that every core `build` module appears exactly once across the pass lists and that no stage precedes one of its deps.

### 7.5 Just-in-time math

Math is not front-loaded. Each chapter gates the first spine part that calls it:

| Spine part | Math that must be green first |
|---|---|
| tracer | M03.1 (L0.0 carries its own "just enough" beat 2) |
| L0 | M00.1 to M00.4, M01.1 to M01.3, M02.1, M02.2, M03.2 to M03.4, M04.1, M04.2, M06.1, M06.3, M07.0, M07.3, M08.1 to M08.3, M09.1, M09.2, M10.1 to M10.4, M11.1; S-M00, S-M01, S-M02, S-M03a, S-M04, S-M05, S-M06a, S-M07a, S-M08, S-M09a, S-M10a, S-M11a |
| L1 | M05.2, M06.2, M07.1, M07.2, M11.2; S-M06b, S-M07b |
| L2 | M03.5, M03.6, M11.4; S-M03b, S-M11b |
| L4 | M07.4; S-M07c |
| L5 | S-M05 (logic), S-M08 |
| L6 | M01.4, M07.5, M07.7; S-M07d |
| L7 | M05.1 |
| L8 | M07.6, M09.3, M09.4; S-M09b |
| L9 | M09.5, M09.6 |
| L11 | M08.4 |
| C1 | M03.5 (`lstsq`); optional M10.5, M10.6 |
| L12 | S-M10b (M10.7), M11.1 `kl_k3` |

### 7.6 Role paths re-expressed as views over the course

| Path | New content |
|---|---|
| `superstar-fde` | `@course` then `@field-engineering`; `capstone.md` moves to `field-engineering/08-mock-engagement/` |
| `llm-foundations` | rows point at L0 to L7 chapters; check column = module ids |
| `frameworks-and-models` | `sq.frameworks-port`, L7.9 |
| `training` | L11, L12, C1, `ml/03` reading |
| `inference-performance` | L8, L9, L10 with `ml/04` depth |
| `ai-full-stack` | gw, ag, L6.7 |
| `field-engineering` | unchanged rows + field.01 to field.07 |
| `interview-drills` (new) | `algorithms/01` to `11`, `15`, competitive programming, iv.01 |

---

## 8. Consolidation map

Churn is minimized: tracks stay top level, moves use `git mv`, and new directories appear only where no topic owns the concept. Historical coursework goes to `archive/` (excluded from the site, the book, and `ss verify`).

### 8.1 Root files and infrastructure

| Item | Fate |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | rewritten front door: the course first (the system, the pass table, link to `paths/course/`), the tracks kept below as "Library"; prerequisite graph regenerated with new dirs |
| `STUDY-PLAN.md` | re-expressed as course pacing (weeks per pass at 10 to 12 h/wk and 20 to 24 h/wk); old math and algorithm plans kept as a "Refresher schedules" appendix |
| `CS-CURRICULUM.md` | kept as an appendix with a "Course passes vs terms" table; "Mathematics must produce working artifacts" points at the math call sites |
| `SOURCES.md` | kept; adds OpenStax Precalculus, Higham, Trefethen and Bau, Boyd and Vandenberghe, Parr and Howard *Matrix Calculus*, Sennrich BPE, Kudo Unigram, FlashAttention, PagedAttention, SGLang, Temporal docs, saige |
| `CHANGELOG.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `LICENSE` | unchanged |
| `sr.yaml` | adds `outputs/supersource-course.pdf` and per-pass PDFs |
| `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock` | unchanged (course tooling lives in `course/harness` and `course/oracle`) |
| `main.py`, `package.json` | candidates for deletion (a `uv init` stub; a broken `main`/`test`); confirm with the owner first |
| `justfile` | `run-12/13/14` recipes move to `archive/justfile`; adds `course-verify`, `course-lint`, `milestone M=`, `drill D=` |
| `swiss-table/` (empty stub) | removed; content becomes `ds.02` |
| `scripts/assemble_book.py` | track list edited (remove `information-theory`, `programming-languages`, `diagramming-and-documentation`; add `responsible-ai`); chapter discovery becomes recursive (`README.md`, then `[0-9][0-9]-*.md`, then `p[0-9][0-9]-*/`); excludes `course/` and `archive/` |
| `scripts/build-book.sh` | `--path course` yields `supersource-course.pdf` with one Part per pass |
| `scripts/check_diagrams.sh` | diagram dirs updated (`software-craftsmanship/05-diagramming-c4/diagrams`, `responsible-ai`) |
| `site/scripts/sync-content.mjs` | `TRACKS` edited the same way; `START` gains `paths/course/README.md` first; `SKIP` gains `^archive/` and every `^course/` path except `course/contracts/` (published so chapter contract links resolve); sidebar shows "Course" then "Library" |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | jobs from 5.14 |
| `skills/study-plan`, `skills/study-session` | drive `ss next` and milestone status |
| `skills/practice-impl` | repurposed as the authoring skill: reference + tests + mutants + chapter + registry row, then `ss verify course` |
| `skills/puzzles` | unchanged |

### 8.3 Practice exercises

All practice rows stay as standalone warm-up drills unless noted (D29). A row whose concept became a course module gains a pointer "course version: <id>". Only the C and C++ build directories hold code with references; the Rust, Go, and Python rows below are entries in a README exercise list, so their mapping is a **README pointer only** (nothing is moved, and the course module is authored fresh).

| Exercise | Course module | Note |
|---|---|---|
| C `01` dynamic array | ds.01, lang.03 | drill kept; it is the lang.03 primer exercise |
| C `02` hash map (linear probing) | ds.02 | **folded in**: becomes the ds.02 baseline and bench reference; practice row removed |
| C `03` intrusive list | ds.03 | drill kept |
| C `04` binary heap | ds.04 | drill kept |
| C `05` merge sort, `06` graph, `10` HTTP parser | none | side quests (toposort reappears in M06.1; sort-merge in data.03) |
| C `07` thread pool | rt.03 | drill kept |
| C `08` arena | rt.02 | drill kept |
| C `09` string interning | none | drill kept (no call site in the system) |
| Rust `01` Vec | none | README pointer; recommended before L10.1 |
| Rust `02` doubly-linked list | ds.07 | README pointer; the radix tree's index-linked LRU list is the safe-Rust answer |
| Rust `03` Robin Hood map | ds.05 | README pointer; ds.05 is authored fresh as the first hash-table chapter |
| Rust `04` mpsc channel, `07` async echo | lang.09, L10.5 | README pointers; bounded admission channel and tokio warm-up are lang.09 exercises |
| Rust `05` iterator adaptors | L1.5 | README pointer; lazy pre-tokenizer chain |
| Rust `06`, `08`, `09`, `10` | none | README pointers, standalone |
| Go `01` to `10` | as listed | every Go row is a README pointer only |
| Go `01` crawler | ag.06 | RAG source |
| Go `02` KV store | gw.06 | response cache |
| Go `03` worker pool | dur.04 | |
| Go `04` sorted set | dur.07 | timer heap |
| Go `05` log-structured storage | dur.01 | event log |
| Go `06` pub/sub | dur.03 | long-poll notifier |
| Go `07` token bucket | gw.03 | |
| Go `08` Raft | dur.10 | |
| Go `09` DI container | none | standalone drill; gw.01 teaches the explicit composition root instead |
| Go `10` gRPC service | dur.04 | worker protocol |
| Python `02` async scheduler | lang.08, data.01 | README pointer (every Python row is a README pointer only) |
| Python `03` generator pipeline | data.02 | `Stage` spine |
| Python `04` property-test framework | craft.04 | README pointer; craft.04 teaches Hypothesis (there is no mini-PBT reference to build on) |
| Python `05` LRU with TTL | gw.06 | re-taught in Go where the call site is |
| Python `08` actor model | data.04 | process-parallel MinHash |
| Python `01`, `06`, `07`, `09`, `10` | none | README pointers, standalone |
| C++ `03`, Zig and Java hash maps | none | **consolidated away**: cpp/03 to `archive/practice/`; zig and java hash-map rows dropped (no references). Six hash maps become two (ds.02, ds.05) |
| other C++, Zig, Java, Scala, TS exercises | none | optional standalone drills outside the course, unchanged |
| `practice/reattempt/manifest.tsv` | | rows re-pointed for moved files; archived rows removed |

## 9. Authoring build order

Every batch ends green on its verification command and leaves the **reference-assembled system** runnable: `ss verify course --e2e` builds a learner repo from `course/ref` plus `course/ref/entry`, and CI runs the batch's milestones against it (`ss milestone <MS-ID>` with `system.toml` pointing at the reference).

**Per-module authoring rule** (enforced by `ss verify course <id>`): the reference passes its tests; the stub fails them; course tests kill every committed mutant and at least 80% of generated ones before pruning; the chapter lints; every already-authored `used_by` module imports it.

| Batch | Harness work | Modules (reference + tests + mutants + chapter + registry row) | Paths, new topic READMEs, committed fixture budget | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **B1 Harness + tracer** | `course/modules/*.toml` loader, `modules.tsv` generator, registry invariants (3.4); dispatch including the `bench` routing (5.2); `ss course init`, `start/check/diff/show/reset/tests/status/next` in all four languages; marker ids, the compiling stubber, and the stubbed-tree compile lint; `course/ref/history/` snapshots and `upgrades` handling; cumulative overlay (Python in the learner's uv env with namespace paths, C object selection in two builds with stub objects and the counting allocator, Rust and Go copy farms with generated manifests); `contracts/VERSION` worktree resolution and the content-hash pre-check; `--ref-deps`; verdict ledger; frozen helpers (`tests/_lib` close, pcg32, gradcheck; `ss_test.h`); `ss milestone` with `system.toml` (`[build]`, port allocation, generated `runtime.toml`, smoke and kind tags, matchers including `tokens-equal` over emitted ids, `trace` for Jaeger, `ci-status`); `ss conform openapi:v0`; `ss drill` framework with the safety gate and journal; `ss doctor`; `ss lint`; `path.tsv` column 5; `ss verify course` checks 1 to 14; `ss check --all --ci` and the learner CI recipe; `ss export` with the test glue; site and book publish `course/contracts/` only; CI `course-verify-changed`, `milestone-p1-kind`, `reference-learner-e2e` (smoke) | lang.01 to lang.07, craft.01, rt.01, M03.1, L0.0, L10.0, gw.00, dep.00, obs.00, ops.00, craft.02; contracts `tinyllm.h` (abi, matmul), `openai-subset.v0.yaml`, `formats/{safetensors,tokenizer}.md` (with the `bytes` tokenizer), `formats/config.schema.json`, `spec/cli-roles.md`, `config/system.schema.json`; MS-P0, MS-P1; root README gains a Course section | `paths/course/` (README, SYSTEM.md), `course-p00-setup`, `course-p01-tracer`; new topic READMEs `software-craftsmanship/12-language-and-tool-primers/`, `ml/08-tinyllm/` (+ `p00`, `p09`, `p10` part READMEs), `ai-platform-engineering/12-gateway/`, `systems/05-incident-response-and-chaos/`, `software-craftsmanship/{06-documentation-writing,08-code-review-and-ci}/`; fixtures 2 MiB (`small-corpora/tinyshakespeare.txt`, public domain) | `ss lint && ss learn --verify && ss verify course --changed origin/main && ss milestone MS-P0 && ss milestone MS-P1 && ss export "$(mktemp -d)/x" --allow-incomplete` |

## 10. Open questions

| # | Question | Current default |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | The fixed Go module path `tinyllm` (D4) means the learner's public agent SDK cannot be `go get`-ed under their own path. Should `ss export --rename-module` rewrite the module path and the vendored test imports? | keep fixed in v1; revisit for export |
| Q2 | Proofs are self-graded in v1. When and how does Lean replace the rubric (`type = "lean"`), and for which claims first? | rubric; Lean pilot on S-M05 induction |
| Q3 | C1 compute on a Mac (4 to 12 h for 10M params, 100M tokens, plus about 3 to 4 h of `short` runs for the core ablations and scaling sizes) is an estimate. Is the `short` config the default, with the full run optional? | full run recommended, `short` accepted |
| Q5 | Licenses of committed fixture slices (TinyStories, SST-2, wiki-mini) and of the SmolLM2-135M and SmolLM2-135M-Instruct weights must be verified and recorded in `MANIFEST.tsv`/`ASSETS.tsv` before B4/B7/B9. | blocking for those batches |
| Q6 | Delete `main.py` and `package.json` at the root? | ask the owner (8.1) |
| Q7 | Glue-file ownership: crate roots (`tl-py/src/lib.rs`) and the Python `__main__` dispatch are shared by several modules. The rule "first creator owns it; it declares all submodules; `ss start` stubs the rest; nobody overwrites it" needs a prototype in B1/B4. | as stated in 2.15 and 5.2 |
| Q8 | Mutation testing cost for Rust and C even with a shared warm target dir, the hash-keyed cache, and `ss check` sampling. Is a cap of 40 mutants per module enough to keep `full-verify` shards inside 90 minutes? | cap at 40; measure in B6 |
| Q11 | `course-corpora` (about 20 MB) and `tiny-hf-models` (about 8 MB) become release assets of the supersource GitHub repo, fetched by `ss fetch`. Is that hosting acceptable, or should they live elsewhere (a Hugging Face dataset repo)? | supersource release assets |
| Q12 | Pass durations (about 67 weeks part-time after adding the primers) are estimates; recalibrate after the first cohort or self-run. | estimates only |
| Q13 | The contracts module path `supersource.urmzd.com/tl/contracts` (D4) uses the site's domain. It resolves only through the `replace`; should the site also serve a `go-import` meta tag so the path is fetchable? | `replace` only |
| Q14 | D34 keeps references readable on disk (honor system), because `--ref-deps` and local mutation grading need them. Is that acceptable, or should graded verdicts (`pass` vs `assisted`) be re-run in the learner's CI against a fresh checkout to make spoiling visible? | honor system plus CI re-run of `ss check --all --ci` |
| Q15 | Scope added by the fixes: core ELECTRA (L6.3) and Unigram (L1.4) through the model zoo and tokenizer ablation, engine speculative decoding (L10.8) and tool calls (L10.9), MLA and MoE as core C1 ablations, and eleven `lang.*` primers. Keep all of them core? | core |

### Resolved since v1

| # | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Q4 | kind and k3d are both supported by the drill safety gate; kind is the CI reference (decision 8). |
| Q9 | Leak checks use the counting allocator on every platform (4.4); Linux CI adds LeakSanitizer; Miri and Rust TSan run nightly on a pinned toolchain. |
| Q10 | A frontier key is never required: MS-agent runs on SmolLM2-135M-Instruct served by the learner's engine with tool calls (L10.9), and CI uses the `faketool` provider. |
| Q11 (v1) | SmolLM2-135M-Instruct is an acceptable agent model, fetched as an asset and labelled as third-party in the model card (D20). |
| Q13, Q14 (v1) | Removed: they reopened decision 3 (optional C++/Zig drills stay) and decision 9 (`responsible-ai/` is a new track). |

### Resolved conflicts not listed in 1.5

These smaller conflicts were resolved inline: test-type letter codes mapped onto the KIND vocabulary (4.0); `L9.0` retired and the C full forward (`model.c`) dropped, with `L9.7` reassigned to the Python C backend (D7, D14); E's tracer ids (`tinyllm.p0.*`, `p9.01`, `p10.00`) mapped to `L0.0`, `M03.1`, `rt.01`, `L10.0`, `gw.00`, `dep.00`, `obs.00`, `ops.00`; the systems section's `rs.*` modules folded into `L1.5` and `L10.1` to `L10.7`; `eval.01` to `eval.03` folded into `L6.7`; E's `gw.09` (engine admin client) folded into `gw.05`; E's math ids mapped to the B catalog (for example `math.04.01` gradcheck is `M04.1`); `gw.08` usage policy moved to Pass 10 with `ethics.05`; `M06.3` moved to Pass 2; `M09.1` moved to Pass 2 (prerequisite of `M09.2`); the C1 LLM judge deferred to Pass 10; postmortems in `docs/postmortems/`; observability config in `deploy/observability/`; cache header `X-TL-Cache`.
