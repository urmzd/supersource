# Supersource Course: B14 Multimodal (vision and speech)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Draft v1, proposed section for `course/DESIGN.md`; not merged (a build workflow is reading DESIGN.md) |
| **Date** | 2026-10-09 |
| **Branch** | `feat/course` |
| **Scope** | Pass 12 (`course-p12-multimodal`): signal and image math, vision models, VLM, Whisper-style ASR, multimodal data, engine encoder cache and encode/prefill/decode disaggregation, API v2.1 content parts and transcriptions, gateway limits, routing and metering, deploy, SLOs, drills, evals, ethics |
| **Scope change** | Kernels are useful, not mandatory. The **core path** runs vision and speech compute on **candle** in the Rust engine (`candle-core`, `candle-nn`; Metal on macOS, CPU in CI), with numpy references in Python. C kernels for im2col conv2d, the conv1d stem, patch embedding, resize, and STFT + mel are **optional** modules (`L13.8`, `L13.9`, `L14.6`) reached through an engine backend switch (`[engine.mm] kernels = "candle" \| "c"`, wired by the optional `L15.8`). Every core milestone passes without them |

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 What the learner builds in Pass 12

After Pass 11 the learner owns a `v1.0.0` text platform. Pass 12 makes it see and hear, end to end, without breaking the text path:

1. **Math** (`M12`, Python): convolution as a linear map, image layouts, resampling, DFT and FFT, windows and STFT, mel filterbanks and log-mel. These are the numpy reference semantics for everything below.
2. **Vision models** (`L13`, Python): conv layers through im2col, 2D RoPE and M-RoPE, a ViT encoder, dynamic resolution and tiling with pixel shuffle, CLIP and SigLIP, image preprocessing to a written spec, and a LLaVA/Idefics3-style VLM that loads **SmolVLM-256M-Instruct** and matches HF logits.
3. **Speech models** (`L14`, Python): the exact Whisper log-mel frontend, a Whisper encoder and decoder that load **whisper-tiny** and match HF, Whisper decoding (special tokens, timestamps, greedy, beam, temperature fallback, long-form), and ASR plus multimodal eval metrics.
4. **Serving** (`L15`, Rust): media preprocessing in the engine, an encoder cache keyed by content hash, prefix-cache keys that carry image hashes, encoder-aware scheduling, encode/prefill/decode disaggregation (EPD), Whisper serving, and `/v1/audio/transcriptions`. Vision towers and Whisper run on candle; the text LLM keeps running on the learner's C kernels. Optional C kernels (conv via im2col, the conv1d stem, patch embedding, resize, STFT + mel) plug in behind `[engine.mm] kernels = "c"` for learners who want the kernel view; core milestones never need them.
5. **Control plane and ops**: gateway media validation, limits, metering, and pool routing (Go); a durable multimodal corpus workflow; encoder and ASR pools as their own Deployments with separate autoscaling; SLOs for encode time and real-time factor; two new drills.
6. **Data, evals, ethics**: image-text and audio-transcript pipelines with perceptual-hash dedup, EXIF stripping, face redaction, speaker-safe splits, consent in the ledger; WER/CER, VQA, captioning, zero-shot accuracy; accent WER gaps; model-card additions.

The pass gate tags `v1.1.0`: an additive minor release (API `2.1.0`, proto minors, formats minors), which is itself a craft.11/craft.12 exercise in shipping additive change behind unchanged contracts.

### 1.2 Decisions for B14

Binding for this batch, in the D-table style of DESIGN 1.5. Ids `E1` onward avoid colliding with `D1` to `D38`.

| # | Decision | Rejected alternative(s) | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | **Kernels are optional in Pass 12.** Conv, STFT, mel, resize, and patch embedding are numpy reference code in `M12` and `L13`/`L14` (core). C versions are optional modules `L13.8` (conv2d via im2col, conv1d stem, patch embed), `L13.9` (resize), `L14.6` (FFT, STFT power, mel, Whisper log), each parity-tested against the learner's Python, with a real call site through the engine switch `[engine.mm] kernels = "c"` wired by optional `L15.8`. New `tinyllm.h` units are additive and always covered by stub objects (DESIGN 2.4), so a library without them loads; the engine refuses `kernels = "c"` at startup when any of them is a stub | mandatory C kernels (first sketch); no kernels at all (first scope change) | Kernels teach the memory layout and FLOP story behind conv and STFT, but the Part 9 kernel lessons already gate the course; making them optional keeps Pass 12 tractable while every optional kernel still runs in the learner's system |
| E2 | **The engine runs vision towers, projectors, and Whisper on candle** (`candle-core`, `candle-nn`), device `cpu` in tests and CI, `metal` locally on macOS. `candle-transformers` and `candle-examples` are **forbidden** by `allowed-deps.toml`. Preprocessing and the four kernel-shaped ops (resize, log-mel, patch embed, conv1d stem) go through one seam, `MmKernels` in `tl-engine/src/mm/kernels.rs`, whose core implementation is candle (plus `rustfft` and `fast_image_resize`) and whose optional implementation is the learner's C | mandatory course C kernels; `candle-transformers` models; ONNX Runtime | candle gives tensors and devices, not models: the learner still writes every layer. This amends D7 for multimodal only: the text LLM graph stays on the learner's C kernels |
| E3 | **Encoder determinism by construction**: the engine never batches tiles or frames of different media items in one encoder call; an item's embeddings depend only on its bytes, the model, and `preprocess_rev`. Whisper decoder steps are not batched across requests in v1 | cross-request encoder batching | candle CPU matmul is not batch-invariant (2.4 is a C-kernel property). One item per call keeps engine output equal to Python and makes the encoder cache sound. Cross-request batching is "Going further" |
| E4 | **One media hash everywhere**: `media_hash = fnv1a64(kind_u8 ‖ raw_bytes)` over the decoded `data:` URL payload or uploaded file bytes. The gateway (Go) and the engine (Rust) compute the same value | perceptual or pixel hashes for cache keys | Cheap, hand-implementable (FNV-1a from M06.3), identical across languages; re-encoded duplicates are a data-pipeline concern (pHash), not a serving one |
| E5 | **Prefix-cache keys via hash ids**: image placeholder tokens are hashed as virtual ids derived from `media_hash`; text-only sequences hash exactly as before | a new `tl_kv_block_hash_mm` in C; upgrading `rt.04` | No C change, no `rt.04` upgrade, the radix tree and `tl_kv_block_hash` work unchanged, and text prefix hits stay bitwise identical (spiral invariant) |
| E6 | **Media decode is a dependency, not a module**: PNG and baseline/progressive JPEG decode via `zune-png`/`zune-jpeg` inside a new crate `tl-media`, exposed to Python through `tinyllm_rs.decode_image`. Everything after decode (EXIF orientation, resize, tiling, normalize) is learner-built | learner-written JPEG decoder (core); Pillow in learner Python | One decode path for Python and Rust makes preprocessing parity a question of the learner's code only; a JPEG decoder is `sq.jpeg-decoder` |
| E7 | **Audio input is WAV only** (RIFF PCM s16le, s24le, f32le, `WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE`, mono or stereo). The learner writes the parser in Python and Rust. Other containers return 400 `unsupported_media_type` | mp3/flac/ogg via crates or ffmpeg | WAV parsing is small and teachable; codecs add nothing to the system |
| E8 | **Preprocessing parity is split from model parity.** Model parity is tested on oracle `pixel_values` and `input_features`; preprocessing parity is tested separately (pixels within 1 uint8 LSB of PIL, log-mel within 1e-4 of HF) | one end-to-end tolerance | PIL rounds between separable passes; isolating it keeps logit tolerances tight |
| E9 | **API is additive v2.1** (`openai-subset.v2.yaml`, `info.version: 2.1.0`): `image_url` content parts with `data:` URLs, `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions`, `usage.prompt_tokens_details.image_tokens`. Engines accept only `data:` URLs and the internal `tl-media:` scheme; remote `https:` URLs are fetched only by the gateway, behind an allowlist and the SSRF guard | engine-side URL fetch; a v3 major | No migration needed; SSRF stays at one trust boundary |
| E10 | **Pass 12 modules that touch Pass 7 to 11 code do it through `upgrades`** (3.4 call-site inheritance): `forward.rs`, `openai.rs`, `template.rs`, `sched.rs`, `http.rs`, `control.rs`, `go/gateway/{server,route,ledger,limit,policy}/`, `go/loadgen`, `go/workflows/{eval_suite,model_release}.go` | new side units with no caller | The registry forbids a Pass 12 unit being "used by" an earlier-pass module; upgrades are how the spiral reaches old code |
| E11 | **Agents and audio-in LLMs stay side quests** (`sq.vision-agent`, `sq.audio-llm`, `sq.streaming-asr`) | `ag.13` core | No Pass 12 module would call them, and an earlier-pass caller violates the pass-order invariant |

### 1.3 Prerequisites

### 1.4 Pass 12 in the spiral

Row to append to DESIGN 7.2:

| Pass | Path | Weeks at 10 to 12 h | System after the pass (all learner-built) | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P12 | course-p12-multimodal | 15 | `v1.1.0`: signal and image math in numpy; ViT, CLIP/SigLIP, SmolVLM-256M and whisper-tiny loaded and matching HF in Python; engine on candle for encoders with an encoder cache, image-aware prefix caching, encoder budgets, EPD, and `/v1/audio/transcriptions`; gateway media limits, metering, and pool routing; multimodal corpora with pHash dedup, EXIF stripping, face redaction, consent; encode and ASR pools with their own autoscaling, SLOs, and drills; accent WER gaps in the model card | MS-P12 = MS-L13 + MS-L14 + MS-mm-corpus + MS-L15 + MS-multimodal-prod |

`MS-multimodal-prod` is the gate's production component (kind, nightly); `MS-P12` composes it with the part milestones and reruns the smoke steps of `MS-P0` to `MS-P11` (DESIGN 7.2), so every text-only check from earlier passes stays green.

Stage list to append to DESIGN 7.4 (`paths/course-p12-multimodal/path.tsv`):

### 1.5 Chapter homes

Rows to append to DESIGN 3.3:

| Guide | `paths/course-p12-multimodal/` (README, `path.tsv`, `milestone.md`); `paths/course/path.tsv` gains `@course-p12-multimodal` |

Existing reading becomes depth, not duplicated content (DESIGN 8.2 style):

| Existing file | Fate in B14 |
|---|---|
| `ml/05-foundation-models/README.md` section 4 (modalities) | stays as the topic overview; cited by the `p13`, `p14` part READMEs as "why now"; its fusion-pattern bullets point to L13.5 (dual encoder) and L13.7 (projector into the LLM) |
| `ml/06-neural-architectures/code/conv2d.c` | worked example for M12.1 beat 3 (valid cross-correlation, output size formula) and the naive baseline that the optional L13.8 im2col kernel is benchmarked against |
| `ml/06-neural-architectures/code/conv2d.cu` | stays in `sq.cnns`; `sq.cuda-kernels` gains a CUDA variant of the optional L13.8 conv |
| `ml/06-neural-architectures/code/lenet.rs`, `alexnet.py` | `sq.cnns` reading; L13.1 beat 6 "Going further" cites them; LeNet becomes the L13.1 learning test architecture in numpy |

---

## 2. New and changed contracts

All paths are relative to `course/contracts/`. Every change is additive (minor) unless marked. `contracts/VERSION` moves to the next minor; learners pick it up with `ss contracts sync`.

### 2.1 Components (rows to amend in DESIGN 2.1)

| 14 | loadgen | Go | `go/loadgen/` | multimodal workload mix, multipart sender, RTF report | load.03 |

### 2.2 C ABI

Additive, optional units (E1). `TL_ABI_VERSION` stays 1: new symbols are a minor addition, and the harness's stub object covers each unit until its module is started (every function returns `TL_EUNSUPPORTED` with `tl_last_error = "unimplemented: <ID>"`), so a library without them still loads in ctypes and links in `tl-sys`. The `abi/` suite gains layout checks for `tl_conv2d_shape`, `tl_resize_cfg`, and `tl_stft_cfg`, and `nm` checks for the new `tl_` symbols. All functions follow DESIGN 2.4: caller-owned buffers, `int64_t` dims, row-major, scratch from `tl_arena`, threads from `tl_pool`, reentrant.

The filterbank and window are inputs, built by the caller from the M12.6 and M12.5 formulas (the engine builds them in Rust from the same spec), so the kernel owns only the compute. C uses libm `log10f`; no other libm call is needed.

### 2.3 Python contracts (`contracts/py/tinyllm/**.pyi`)

`NDArray` is `numpy.ndarray`; `Tensor` is the L0.1 autograd tensor. Images are `uint8[H, W, C]` (HWC, RGB) until normalized; `pixel_values` are `float32[N, C, H, W]`.

### 2.6 File formats (`formats/`)

| Artifact | Format |
|---|---|
| `formats/image-preprocess.md` (new) | The preprocessing spec every implementation follows: decode (E6), EXIF orientation 1 to 8 applied before anything else, RGBA composited on white, grayscale and palette expanded to RGB; resize kernels `nearest`, `bilinear`, `bicubic` (a = -0.5, the PIL value; torch uses -0.75), `lanczos3`; pixel-center convention `src = (dst + 0.5) * scale - 0.5`; antialias support `support * max(1, in/out)`; weights normalized per output pixel; PIL mode: horizontal pass, round half up and clip to u8, vertical pass, round and clip; then `x * rescale_factor`, then `(x - mean) / std` in f32, CHW. Tiling: LLaVA-NeXT AnyRes and Idefics3 splitting as in 2.3; **token count**: `image_token_count` per processor is normative and fixture-tested in Python, Rust, and Go. `preprocess_rev` (u32) increments on any change and is part of every encoder-cache key |
| `formats/preprocessor-config.schema.json` (new) | subset of HF `preprocessor_config.json` / `processor_config.json` that loads unchanged for SmolVLM-256M-Instruct, LLaVA, CLIP, SigLIP, and Whisper; unknown keys ignored, unsupported values (for example `resample` 4 box) rejected |
| `formats/mel-spec.md` (new) | Whisper features: 16 kHz mono f32, pad or trim to 480000 samples (30 s) per window, periodic Hann(400), `n_fft = 400` (factors 2^4 · 5^2, so FFTs are mixed radix), hop 160, `center = True` with reflect padding, 201 bins, drop the last frame (3000 frames), power spectrum, Slaney mel filterbank with Slaney normalization (fmin 0, fmax 8000) for 80 or 128 mels, `log10(max(m, 1e-10))`, `max(x, max(x) - 8)`, `(x + 4) / 4`. Long-form: features over the whole file, windows of 3000 frames at `seek`. Mono downmix is the channel mean; resampling per `resample_audio` (torchaudio `sinc_interp_hann`, width 6, rolloff 0.99) |
| `spec/asr-decoding.md` (new) | SOT sequence, special tokens, language detection, timestamp rules, suppress lists, `best_of` sampling with PCG32 per `spec/sampling.md` (one `uniform_f64` per token, seed per window = SplitMix64(seed, window index)), beam search (log-prob sum, length-normalized by token count, ties to the lowest token id, `patience`), temperature fallback (compression ratio `len(utf8) / len(zlib.compress(utf8, 9))`, average log-prob, no-speech probability at the SOT position), long-form seek and prompt conditioning (`<|startofprev|>` + up to 223 previous tokens; dropped when the last temperature exceeded 0.5), segment output, and the `basic` text normalizer for WER |
| `formats/encoder-entry.md` (new) | In memory: `EncoderEntry` (2.4). **Export envelope** used by `PushEmbeddings` (the embedding transfer wire format): header `{magic "TLEM", u16 version = 1, u16 dtype (TL_F32 or TL_F16 codes from 2.4), u64 media_hash, u32 preprocess_rev, u32 n_tokens, u32 d, u8 kind, u8 detail, u16 model_id_len, model_id utf-8}`, payload `[n_tokens][d]` row-major little-endian, then `u32 crc32c` over everything before it. Bad magic, CRC, version, or model id: rejected (`FAILED_PRECONDITION`) |
| `formats/kv-block.md` (minor) | new section **Multimodal hash ids**: the hashed token stream replaces the placeholder at offset `j` of an image span with `0x8000_0000 \| ((h >> (31 * (j & 1))) & 0x7FFF_FFFF)` where `h = media_hash`; all other ids are unchanged, so text-only blocks hash exactly as in v1. Model ids are always below `2^31`. KV payload formats v1 and v2 are unchanged |
| `formats/config.schema.json` (minor) | `tl_arch` adds `vit, clip, siglip, idefics3, llava, llava_next, qwen2vl, whisper`; `tl_modalities` in `{text, image, audio}`; the engine serves `bigram`, `llama`, `idefics3`, `whisper` (`llava` optional through the zoo) |
| `formats/corpus-shard.md` (minor) | image-text shards: `id string, image_png binary, width int32, height int32, caption string, source_id string, url string, license_spdx string, phash fixed_size_binary(8), dhash fixed_size_binary(8), faces_redacted int32, clip_score float32, near_dup_cluster int64, split string`. Audio shards: `id string, audio_wav binary (16 kHz mono s16le), duration_s float32, transcript string, lang string, speaker_key fixed_size_binary(16) (HMAC of the source speaker id; never the id), consent string, source_id string, license_spdx string, pii_redactions int32, near_dup_cluster int64, split string`. No document, image, or speaker crosses splits |
| `formats/ledger.schema.json` (minor) | adds `modality: text\|image\|audio`, `biometric: bool`, `consent: none\|public-domain\|cc-licensed\|explicit-donation`, `attribution: string`, `prohibited_uses: [string]` (for example `speaker-identification`). `ModelRelease` refuses `biometric: true` sources whose `consent` is `none` |
| `formats/usage.v2.sql` (minor of the per-version ledger from craft.14) | adds `images int, image_tokens int, audio_seconds real, modality text` |
| `formats/policy.v1.schema.json` (minor) | `match.modalities: [image, audio]`, `limits{max_images, max_image_pixels, max_audio_seconds}`, action `deny` with reason `media_policy` |
| `formats/eval-case.schema.json` (minor) | `input` may carry `media: [{kind, path, sha256}]`; suites `asr`, `vqa`, `caption`, `zeroshot`, `mm_bias` |
| `templates/MODEL_CARD.md` (minor) | sections "Modalities and input limits", "Per-group performance" (WER per accent with CIs), "Prohibited uses" (speaker identification, face recognition), "Third-party components" (SmolVLM-256M, whisper-tiny) |
| `spec/cli-roles.md` (minor) | verbs `{tinyllm} features`, `transcribe`, `vlm generate`, `logits --mm-prompts`, `train {lenet,clip,vlm}`, `eval {zeroshot,vqa,caption,asr}`, `preprocess image`; `{corpus} mm build`; `{ctl} chat --image`, `{ctl} transcribe`. Every generating verb ends with the JSON line `{"ids": [...], "text": ...}` |

New error rows (shape unchanged):

| Status | `type` / `code` | When |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid_request_error` / `invalid_media` | undecodable image or WAV, bad base64, `tl-media:` from a client |
| 400 | `invalid_request_error` / `unsupported_media_type` | not PNG/JPEG, not RIFF WAV |
| 413 | `invalid_request_error` / `media_too_large` | request bytes, image bytes, pixels (header-checked before decode), image count, or audio seconds over limits |
| 422 | `invalid_request_error` / `unsupported_parameter` | `image_url` to a text-only model, `timestamp_granularities[]=word`, remote URL with fetch disabled (`param: messages[i].content[j].image_url.url`) |
| 451 | `policy_error` / `usage_policy` | a `media_policy` rule |

Conformance cases (`course/conformance/openapi/cases/`, tier, `requires`):

| Case | Tier | Asserts |
|---|---|---|
| `mm.image.data_url` | engine | `requires = ["L15.3"]`: PNG and JPEG data URLs, greedy output stable across 2 calls |
| `mm.image.detail_low` | engine | `detail: low` gives `image_tokens` equal to one global tile's count |
| `mm.usage.image_tokens` | both | `usage.prompt_tokens_details.image_tokens` equals `image_token_count` from the fixture table; `prompt_tokens` includes them |
| `mm.cache.same_image` | engine | `requires = ["L15.2"]`: repeated request reports `cached_tokens >= image_tokens`; a different image with the same text reports `cached_tokens < first image span start + 64` (no false hit) |
| `mm.errors.*` | both | 400, 413, 422 rows above; pixel bomb (a 30000 x 30000 PNG header in under 1 KiB) is rejected without allocating the pixels (RSS probe on `/metrics`) |
| `mm.stream.equals_nonstream` | engine | the text-path invariant with an image |
| `audio.json`, `audio.verbose_json`, `audio.srt`, `audio.vtt`, `audio.text` | both | `requires = ["L15.7"]`: schemas; SRT `HH:MM:SS,mmm` and VTT `HH:MM:SS.mmm` timestamps; segments monotone |
| `audio.stream` | engine | `transcript.text.delta` concatenation equals `transcript.text.done.text` |
| `audio.errors.*` | both | mp3 bytes give `unsupported_media_type`; 31-minute WAV gives 413 |
| `mm.remote_url` | gateway | `requires = ["gw.09"]`: non-allowlisted, private, link-local, and redirect-to-private URLs refused; allowlisted fixture host inlined |
| `mm.internal_scheme` | gateway | client-sent `tl-media:` refused; `X-TL-MM-Handle` stripped |

### 2.8 gRPC (`proto/tl/*/v1`)

New `tl/encoder/v1/encoder.proto` (D6 pattern: dedup by hash, push missing, release on abort):

```proto
syntax = "proto3";
package tl.encoder.v1;
service EncoderService {                                   // served by role=encode engines on :50051 next to EngineControl
  rpc Encode(EncodeRequest) returns (EncodeResponse);      // preprocess + encode each item, push to target, return refs
}
service EmbeddingTransfer {                                // served by unified and prefill engines on :50053 ({emb_port} locally)
  rpc HasEmbeddings(HasEmbeddingsRequest) returns (HasEmbeddingsResponse);
  rpc PushEmbeddings(stream EmbeddingChunk) returns (EmbeddingAck);
  rpc Release(ReleaseEmbeddingsRequest) returns (ReleaseEmbeddingsResponse);
}
message MediaInput { uint32 kind = 1; bytes data = 2; uint64 media_hash = 3; string detail = 4; }  // data <= 4 MiB per item, larger items stream via chunks
message EncodeRequest { string request_id = 1; string model = 2; repeated MediaInput media = 3;
  string target = 4;                                        // host:port of the target's EmbeddingTransfer
  int64 deadline_unix_ms = 5; }
message MediaRef { uint64 media_hash = 1; uint32 kind = 2; uint32 preprocess_rev = 3; uint32 n_tokens = 4; string detail = 5; }
message EncodeResponse { string handle_id = 1; repeated MediaRef refs = 2; uint32 encoded = 3; uint32 deduped = 4; double encode_ms = 5; }
message HasEmbeddingsRequest { string model = 1; repeated MediaRef refs = 2; }
message HasEmbeddingsResponse { repeated bool present = 1; }
message EmbeddingChunk { string handle_id = 1; MediaRef ref = 2; uint32 chunk_index = 3; uint32 n_chunks = 4;
  bytes payload = 5;                                        // formats/encoder-entry.md envelope, split at 4 MiB
  uint32 crc32c = 6; }
message EmbeddingAck { string handle_id = 1; uint32 received = 2; uint32 deduped = 3; }
message ReleaseEmbeddingsRequest { string handle_id = 1; }  message ReleaseEmbeddingsResponse {}
```

Minor additions to existing protos:

```proto
// tl/engine/v1/engine.proto
message PrefillRequest { /* 1..7 unchanged */ repeated tl.encoder.v1.MediaRef media = 8; string mm_handle = 9; }
message InfoResponse   { /* 1..6 unchanged */ repeated string modalities = 7; uint32 preprocess_rev = 8; }
// tl/control/v1/control.proto
message WorkerStatus   { /* 1..12 unchanged; role adds "encode" */ repeated string modalities = 13;
  int32 encoder_queue_depth = 14; int64 encoder_cache_free_bytes = 15; string emb_address = 16; }
```

**EPD flow.** The gateway parses media (gw.09), picks encoder E (affinity on the first `media_hash`, bounded by `encoder_queue_depth`) and target T (unified, or prefill P then decode D per 2.7). It rewrites each image part to `tl-media:<hex16>` and calls `E.Encode(target = T.emb_address)`. E asks T `HasEmbeddings`, encodes only missing items (its own encoder cache first), pushes envelopes, and returns refs. The gateway then sends the rewritten chat request to T with `X-TL-MM-Handle: <handle_id>` (internal, stripped from clients). T resolves `tl-media:` refs from its encoder cache, pinned for the request. A miss at T returns internal 409 `mm_missing` and the gateway retries once through the unified path that encodes locally. On abort the gateway calls `Release`. Encoder loss before first byte: retry another E, then local encode (`[gateway.media].epd_fallback = "local"`), counted in `tl.gateway.epd.fallbacks`.

### 2.9 Runtime configuration (`config/runtime.schema.json`, minor)

### 2.10 Ports and Kubernetes objects (rows to add to DESIGN 2.13)

| Component | Helm release (chart) | Kind | Replicas on kind | Ports |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| engine, VLM pool | `<system>-engine-vlm` (`<system>-engine`, `role: unified`, SmolVLM model dir) | Deployment + KEDA `ScaledObject` on `tl_engine_queue_depth{model="smolvlm-256m"}` | 1 (max 2) | 8000, 50051, 50052, **50053** emb, 9464 |

SLOs (course defaults, scaled by `ss bench --calibrate --in-cluster`; required alert names added to `otel/slo.schema.json`):

| SLO | Default | Alerts |
|---|---|---|

C units in Pass 12 are optional only (E1): L13.8, L13.9, L14.6, wired into the engine by optional L15.8. No core module lists them in `deps`, so `ss check` on every core module and every core milestone runs without them; their stub objects keep `libtinyllm` loadable.

## 5. Milestones

All specs are `course/milestones/<MS-ID>.toml` in the DESIGN 5.7 format. New matcher (harness work, section 7): **`npz-close`**: compares named arrays in a produced `.npz` with a fixture under `{atol, rtol, max_lsb, top_k_equal}`. New placeholder: `{emb_port}`. Every step lists its CI tier; PR CI runs `--smoke` (tiny assets), nightly runs real weights.

### 5.2 MS-L14 (speech)

`requires = ["L14.1", ..., "L14.5", "M12.4", "M12.5", "M12.6"]`.

### 5.3 MS-mm-corpus

| # | Step | Learner command | Assertion | CI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Build | `{corpus} mm build --config {fixture:mm-corpus/small-mm.toml} --workers {w}`, matrix `w = [1, 4]` | `file-produced`: image and audio shards and `_MANIFEST.json` pass `conformance/formats/`; output hash equal across worker counts | pr, smoke |
| 2 | Dedup and privacy | `{corpus} mm audit --manifest {out:build}/_MANIFEST.json` | `json-last-line`: `near_dup_recall >= 0.95`, `false_drops == 0`, `exif_chunks == 0`, `faces_redacted >= {fixture count}`, `speakers_crossing_splits == 0`, `raw_speaker_ids == 0` | pr, smoke |

| 4 | Durable | `{ctl} data build-mm --dataset mm-small --version v1` under `KillLoop` | manifest hash equals step 1 | nightly |

### 5.4 MS-L15 (multimodal serving, local processes)

Services from `system.toml`: `engine` instances `vlm` (tiny-idefics3 in PR, SmolVLM nightly), `encode` (`role = encode`), `asr` (tiny-whisper in PR, whisper-tiny nightly), `text` (the Pass 7 engine), and `gateway`; the runner allocates `{port}`, `{grpc_port}`, `{emb_port}`.

| # | Step | Command | Assertion | CI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Engine conformance | `ss conform openapi:v2 --target engine --cases 'mm.*,audio.*'` against `vlm` and `asr` | 100% | pr, smoke |
| 2 | Engine equals Python | `{ctl} chat --base {vlm.api_base} --image {fixture:L13.7/img-0.png} --prompt-file ... --greedy --max-tokens 32 --json` | `tokens-equal` vs `{tinyllm} vlm generate` ids for the same inputs (near-tie rule) | pr, smoke |
| 3 | Cache correctness | `{ctl} chat ... --image A` twice, then `--image B` with the same text | second A: `cached_tokens >= image_tokens`; B: no hit past the image span start; `tl_engine_encoder_cache_hits_total` increments by 1 | pr, smoke |
| 4 | Encoder budget | `{loadgen} --target {vlm.api_base} --workload {fixture:load/images-burst.toml} --duration 30s` with `TL_ENGINE__MM__MAX_ENCODER_TOKENS_PER_STEP=128` | error rate 0; text requests in the mix keep `tpot_p95` within 1.2x of the text-only run (a `perf` step, `ci = "local"`); KV and pins at baseline afterwards | pr (functional), local (perf) |
| 5 | EPD | `{gateway}` with `epd = { encode_pool = "encode" }`; `{ctl} chat --base {gateway.api_base} ... --greedy --json` | ids equal to step 2; one trace has `gateway.media`, `Encode`, `encoder.transfer`, `engine.prefill` | pr, smoke |
| 6 | EPD fault | kill `encode` mid-run (runner `signal = "KILL"`) | in-flight image requests complete via local fallback or fail before first byte with 503; `tl_gateway_epd_fallbacks_total > 0`; no spliced streams | pr |
| 7 | Transcription | `{ctl} transcribe --base {gateway.api_base} --file {fixture:L14.1/clips/en-0.wav} --format verbose_json` | text equals `{tinyllm} transcribe --greedy` text; `json-schema` verbose; `--format srt` parses | pr, smoke |
| 8 | Mixed load | `{loadgen} --target {gateway.api_base} --workload {fixture:load/mm-mix.toml} --rate 4 --duration 60s` | `error_rate == 0`; report has `encode_ms`, `rtf`, `image_tokens`; ledger image tokens and audio seconds equal engine usage | pr (30 s), nightly (60 s) |
| 9 | Real weights | steps 2, 5, 7 on SmolVLM-256M and whisper-tiny | as above | nightly |

### 5.5 MS-multimodal-prod (kind; production component of the P12 gate)

| # | Step | Assertion | CI |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Deploy | `helm upgrade --install` of gateway, `engine-text`, `engine-vlm`, `engine-encode` (2), `engine-asr` from the learner's values files; rollouts healthy; dep.03 policy passes on every release | kind (nightly) |
| 2 | Conformance through the NodePort | `ss conform openapi:v2 --target gateway --base {deploy.gateway_url} --cases 'mm.*,audio.*'` and the full v2 smoke set | kind |
| 3 | Traces | `trace` matcher: `gateway.media` > `gateway.route` > `Encode` > `encoder.transfer` > `engine.encode`/`engine.prefill` > `engine.decode` for one image request; `asr.window` spans for one transcription | kind |
| 4 | Metrics and rules | `promscrape`: every 2.11 metric present with contract names; `multimodal.yaml` rules loaded with the required alert names | kind |
| 5 | SLOs under load | `{loadgen} --target {deploy.gateway_url} --workload mm-mix.toml --rate {calibrated}` for 10 min; `promql` with `hold_s = 300`: encode p95, image TTFT p95, ASR RTF p95, text TTFT p95 within their SLOs | kind |
| 6 | Separate autoscaling | image burst: `encode` replicas rise to >= 2 and return to min within 5 min after; `asr` replicas unchanged; then an audio burst scales `asr` only | kind |
| 7 | Drills | `ss drill start encoder-pool-loss --seed {n}` and `image-flood` with the scripted responder: detected and resolved | kind (rotation) |
| 8 | Release gates | `{ctl} release --model smolvlm-256m --version v1` and `--model whisper-tiny` through `ModelRelease`: multimodal suites, accent-gap ceiling, consent gate, model card sections | kind |
| 9 | Tag | `git-log` and a `v1.1.0` tag; changelog lists API 2.1.0 and proto minors | local |

### 5.6 MS-mm-kernels (optional, not part of the gate)

`requires = ["L13.8", "L13.9", "L14.6", "L15.8"]`, `optional = true`. Recorded in `STATUS.md` when earned; `MS-P12` never requires it.

| # | Step | Command | Assertion | CI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Kernel parity | `ss parity conv2d conv1d patch_embed resize stft.mel` | C vs the learner's Python and vs oracle fixtures within the 3.4 bounds | pr, smoke |
| 2 | Engine switch, vision | engine `vlm` started twice from the same template with `TL_ENGINE__MM__KERNELS=candle` and `=c`; `{ctl} chat --image {fixture:L13.7/img-0.png} ... --greedy --json` against each | `tokens-equal` between the two runs and against `{tinyllm} vlm generate` (near-tie rule) | pr, smoke |
| 3 | Engine switch, speech | `{ctl} transcribe --file {fixture:L14.1/clips/en-0.wav}` against `asr` with `kernels = "c"` | text equals the `candle` run | pr, smoke |
| 4 | Stub refusal | start `vlm` with `kernels = "c"` and `--ref-deps` disabled while one unit is a stub (scratch copy) | the engine exits non-zero naming the unstarted module | pr |
| 5 | Speed | `{tinyllm} bench mm --kernels candle,c` (cpu) | reports `speedup_c` for preprocess and patch embed (a `perf` step, `ci = "local"`, no bound) | local |

**MS-P12** (pass gate) = MS-L13 + MS-L14 + MS-mm-corpus + MS-L15 + MS-multimodal-prod, and reruns the smoke steps of MS-P0 to MS-P11 (text paths, tracer bigram, durable kill loop, agent with `faketool`). Milestone catalog row for DESIGN 5.7:

| Milestone | Pass | Pass condition | CI |
|---|---|---|---|
| MS-L13, MS-L14 | P12 | conv and contrastive learning; preprocessing within 1 LSB; tiny VLM and tiny Whisper logits; SmolVLM logits 1e-3 and greedy exact; log-mel 1e-4; whisper-tiny greedy with timestamps exact; WER within 1 point of the oracle | pr (tiny, `--smoke`), nightly (real weights) |
| MS-mm-corpus | P12 | shards, dedup, EXIF, faces, speaker-disjoint splits, consent ledger; durable under kills | pr, nightly |
| MS-L15 | P12 | engine conformance, engine == Python, cache correctness, encoder budget, EPD and its fault, transcription, mixed load and metering | pr (tiny), nightly (real), local (perf) |
| MS-multimodal-prod | P12 | kind deploy with separate pools and autoscaling, traces, SLOs, drills ops.13 and ops.14, release gates, `v1.1.0` | nightly (kind) |
| MS-mm-kernels | P12 (optional) | C conv, resize, STFT + mel parity; engine output identical with `kernels = "c"` and `"candle"`; stub refusal | pr (when started), local (perf) |

## 6. Fixtures, assets, oracle generators, licenses

### 6.1 Committed fixtures (`course/fixtures/`)

| Fixture | Generator | Contents | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| `M12/*` | `gen_signal_fixtures.py` | conv fwd/bwd and unfold cases, PIL resize outputs on 6 small images per kernel, torchaudio resample, numpy FFT/DCT, torch STFT, librosa mel filters | about 1.5 MiB |
| `L13.6/images/`, `L13.6/*_pixel_values.npz` | `gen_image_fixtures.py` | 12 small PNG/JPEG (EXIF orientations 1 to 8, CMYK, 16-bit, truncated, pixel-bomb header), CLIP/SigLIP/Idefics3 processor outputs, 40-size token-count table | about 1.5 MiB |
| `L13.2`, `L13.4`, `L13.5`, `L13.7` | `gen_mrope_fixtures.py`, `gen_tiling_fixtures.py`, `gen_contrastive_fixtures.py` | M-RoPE position ids, tile grids and prompt strings, loss values, tiny prompts and pixel values | about 0.5 MiB |
| `L14.1/clips/`, `L14.4/traces.npz`, `whisper-parity/` (ids only) | `gen_whisper_parity.py` | 6 clips of at most 4 s at 16 kHz s16 (public-domain speech from LibriVox-derived LibriSpeech is CC BY 4.0, so these use CC0 Common Voice clips), log-mel for 2 clips (the rest regenerated within the test from WAV), recorded decoder logits for 8 traces as top-64 sparse rows, expected ids | about 1.5 MiB |
| `smolvlm-parity/` | `gen_smolvlm_parity.py` | 4 CC0 images (256 px), prompts, `pixel_values` for the global tile only (f16 stored, compared after upcast), last-position logits top-256 sparse, greedy ids | about 1 MiB |
| `mm-corpus/small-mm.toml`, `load/*.toml`, `configs/{clip-tiny,vlm-tiny}.json` | hand-written | configs | < 0.1 MiB |
| `L13.8`, `L13.9`, `L14.6` | reuse the `M12/*` goldens; `gen_signal_fixtures.py` adds batch-invariance and groups cases | conv shapes incl. SmolVLM patch embed (3x512x512, p 16) slices, Whisper stem on 1 s | about 0.3 MiB |
| **B14 total** | | | **about 6.3 MiB** |

DESIGN 9 allocates the full 50 MiB to B1 to B13. B14 needs the cap raised to **56 MiB** (Q1), or 6 MiB moved from committed `ops-torch` into a fetched asset.

### 6.2 Fetched assets (`course/fixtures/ASSETS.tsv`)

### 6.3 Oracle generators (`course/oracle/`, maintainer only)

New pinned dependencies: `torchaudio`, `torchvision`, `pillow`, `librosa`, `openai-whisper`, `jiwer`, `imagehash`, `opencv-python-headless`, `soundfile`.

| Script | Produces |
|---|---|
| `gen_signal_fixtures.py` | M12 goldens (torch conv/unfold/fold, PIL resize, torchvision antialias, torchaudio resample, numpy/scipy FFT and DCT, torch STFT, librosa mel and dB) |
| `gen_image_fixtures.py` | processor outputs for CLIP, SigLIP, Idefics3, LLaVA-NeXT; EXIF fixture JPEGs; token-count table; bomb headers |

| `gen_tiny_mm_models.py` | `tiny-mm-models`: random tiny `ViTModel`, `CLIPModel`, `SiglipModel`, `Idefics3ForConditionalGeneration`, `LlavaForConditionalGeneration`, `LlavaNextForConditionalGeneration`, `Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration`, `WhisperForConditionalGeneration` with configs, safetensors, logits |
| `gen_smolvlm_parity.py` | margin-filtered (image, prompt) pairs (top-2 margin >= 1e-3 at every greedy step), pixel values, logits, greedy ids, param count |
| `gen_whisper_parity.py` | `WhisperFeatureExtractor` features; HF `generate` ids with timestamps; `openai-whisper` `transcribe` segments for long-form and fallback; recorded logits traces; margin-filtered clips |
| `gen_mm_shapes.py` | procedural images (32x32 and 128x128), captions, VQA questions, zero-shot labels; seeded by `spec/pcg32.md` so the learner can audit it |
| `gen_mm_pairs.py` | `mm-pairs-mini` sampling and planted variants; `imagehash` and OpenCV cascade oracle labels |
| `gen_asr_eval.py` | `asr-mini`, `cv-accent-mini` manifests; `jiwer` WER and per-group oracle values |

`oracle-drift` (weekly) covers all of them; integer outputs (token ids, hash bits, tile grids, token counts) compare exactly, floats within the DESIGN 5.11 tolerances.

## 7. B14 batch entry (DESIGN section 9 format)

| Batch | Harness work | Modules (reference + tests + mutants + chapter + registry row) | Paths, new topic READMEs, committed fixture budget | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **B14 Multimodal: vision and speech** | registry: pass 12 and the `L15` part (`L1[0-9]` already matches the id regex; no regex change); Rust farm builds with `candle-core`/`candle-nn` (cpu feature set in CI, `metal` only when the learner enables it locally), shared warm `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` sized for candle; `allowed-deps.toml` additions and the forbidden list (`candle-transformers`, `candle-examples`); new crate `tl-media` in the contract pre-check and the PyO3 build (`tinyllm_rs.decode_image`); matcher `npz-close`; placeholder `{emb_port}` and runner `signal` steps for EPD faults; `ss conform --cases` filter and multipart request support in the OpenAPI runner (`openai-core` validation of `multipart/form-data`, official `openai` client `audio.transcriptions`); conformance suite `encoder-grpc/`; parity suites `image.decode`, `image.preprocess`, `image.tokens`, `audio.logmel`, `asr.decode`, `media.hash`, `embed.wire.v1`; generated code for `tl/encoder/v1` in `tl-proto` and `contracts/go/gen`; C overlay and stub objects for the optional `conv.h`, `image.h`, `audio.h` units (two builds, sanitizers, counting allocator, as in B8); the `tl-sys` crate root contract declares `mm`, stubbed until L15.8 starts; ctypes parity suites `conv2d`, `conv1d`, `patch_embed`, `resize`, `stft.mel`; registry support for `optional = true` milestones; drills `encoder-pool-loss` (`scale-zero`) and `image-flood` (`tenant-flood` with a `media-flood` loadgen profile) with scripted responders; `hf-real` extended with `smolvlm-256m-instruct` and `whisper-tiny` (cached by sha); `kind-e2e` rotation adds ops.13, ops.14 and the `MS-multimodal-prod` steps; fixture cap raised per Q1 | lang.12, lang.13; M12.1 to M12.6, S-M12; L13.1 to L13.7; L14.1 to L14.5; L15.1 to L15.7; optional L13.8, L13.9, L14.6, L15.8 and MS-mm-kernels (authored last; the core verification never depends on them); ds.10; data.10 to data.13; dur.13; gw.09 to gw.11; load.03; dep.08; obs.06; ops.13, ops.14; ethics.07, ethics.08; craft.24; review.04; MS-L13, MS-L14, MS-mm-corpus, MS-L15, MS-multimodal-prod, MS-P12; side quests sq.audio-llm, sq.streaming-asr, sq.vision-agent, sq.jpeg-decoder, sq.video-frames | `paths/course-p12-multimodal/` (README, `path.tsv`, `milestone.md`); `paths/course/path.tsv` gains `@course-p12-multimodal`; new topic README `math/12-signals-and-images/`; new part READMEs `ml/08-tinyllm/{p13-vision,p14-speech,p15-multimodal-serving}/`; chapter indexes in `data-engineering/05-corpus-pipeline/`, `ai-platform-engineering/12-gateway/`, `responsible-ai/{02-privacy-and-pii,04-bias-and-safety-evals}/`; `ml/05-foundation-models/README.md` section 4 gains pointers to L13.5, L13.7, L14; fixtures 6 MiB | `ss lint && ss learn --verify && ss verify course --changed origin/main && ss parity && ss conform openapi:v2 --target engine --cases 'mm.*,audio.*' && ss milestone MS-P12 --smoke` (nightly: `hf-real` for MS-L13/MS-L14/MS-L15 real-weight steps, `kind-e2e` for MS-multimodal-prod) |

**Learner time.** About **15 weeks** at 10 to 12 h per week: primers 0.5, M12 and S-M12 2, L13 4, L14 3, data and ethics 1.5, L15 3, gateway, load, deploy, observability, drills, review 1. The course total moves from about 67 to about 82 weeks. The optional kernel track (L13.8, L13.9, L14.6, L15.8) adds about 2 weeks for learners who take it. Planning estimate only (DESIGN Q12).

**Authoring order inside B14**: M12 and S-M12, then L13.1 to L13.7 and MS-L13 (Python only, unblocks fixtures), L14 and MS-L14, data and ethics with MS-mm-corpus, then lang.13, ds.10, L15 with MS-L15, then gw, load, dep, obs, ops, craft, review with MS-multimodal-prod, and last the optional kernels with MS-mm-kernels. Each module follows the per-module authoring rule of DESIGN 9 (reference passes, stub fails, mutants killed, chapter lints, every authored `used_by` imports it).

**Rows to update when merged**: DESIGN 2.1, 2.3, 2.6, 2.7, 2.9, 2.10 (`asr-decoding.md`), 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.15, 3.3, 4.2 totals, 4.7, 4.8, 5.7 catalog, 5.8 parity table, 5.14 CI jobs, 7.1 tree, 7.2, 7.3 (new rows: `Preprocessor` behind `preprocess_rev`; API v2.1; engine roles add `encode`), 7.4, 7.5, 9 (budget sum), 10.

## 8. Open questions

| # | Question | Current default |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | The 50 MiB committed-fixture cap is fully allocated by B1 to B13. Raise it to 56 MiB for B14, or move about 6 MiB of existing goldens (`ops-torch`) to a fetched asset? | raise to 56 MiB |
| Q2 | Licenses to verify and record in `ASSETS.tsv` before authoring: SmolVLM-256M-Instruct (Apache-2.0 per card; component terms), whisper-tiny (MIT in openai/whisper vs Apache-2.0 on the HF card), PD12M per-item status and metadata license, LibriSpeech CC BY 4.0 attribution text, Common Voice CC0 plus its no-re-identification terms, the OpenCV Haar cascade (Intel License), the public-domain portraits | blocking for B14 |
| Q3 | `fast_image_resize` is not documented as PIL bit-compatible. If the core engine path misses the 1 LSB bound against PIL, port the learner's Python resize to plain Rust in L15.1, or relax the core bound to 2 LSB (the optional C path L13.9 is bit-exact with the Python reference either way)? | test early in B14; fall back to a plain Rust port of M12.3 |
| Q13 | Optional kernels run on the host only. With `device = "metal"`, should `kernels = "c"` be rejected (current rule) or force a host round trip for the four ops? | reject the combination at startup |
| Q14 | The registry has optional build modules (L11.2, L11.3) but no optional milestones. Is `optional = true` on `MS-mm-kernels` the right mechanism, or should it be a side-quest milestone outside `MS-*` pass gates? | `optional = true`, excluded from every pass gate |
| Q4 | candle CPU matmul is not batch-invariant, so E3 forbids cross-request encoder batching and cross-request Whisper decoder batching. Is the throughput cost acceptable for the RTF and encode SLO defaults, or should Whisper decoding batch with a looser "greedy equal under near-tie" check? | no cross-request batching in v1 |
| Q5 | Metal results differ from CPU beyond the f32 tolerances. Should any milestone step run on Metal, or is Metal purely a local `perf` concern? | Metal only in `ci = "local"` perf steps |
| Q6 | SmolVLM's exact `Idefics3ImageProcessor` behavior for the global image (padding vs distortion) and the newer `SmolVLMForConditionalGeneration` class names depend on the pinned transformers version. Pin which version, and does the loader accept both key layouts? | pin at authoring; accept both layouts |
| Q7 | Should the audio-in LLM (`sq.audio-llm`) and streaming ASR (`sq.streaming-asr`) become core in a later pass once a call site exists (for example a voice agent)? | side quests |
| Q8 | E7 limits audio to WAV. Is that acceptable for the OpenAI-compatible endpoint (official clients often send mp3/m4a), or should the gateway transcode with an allowed dependency? | WAV only; 400 `unsupported_media_type` otherwise |
| Q9 | Vision bias evals have no person images (consent, E-ethics). Are domain-disparity and counterfactual caption probes enough for ethics.07, or should a consented, licensed face dataset be sourced? | probes only; no face datasets |
| Q10 | Pass 12 follows the `v1.0.0` gate. Should multimodal instead be an optional track after P11 (not counted in "the course"), given 15 added weeks? | core pass 12 |
| Q11 | `hf-real` nightly grows by about 0.65 GB of weights and SmolVLM numpy inference time. Split it into `hf-real-text` and `hf-real-mm` jobs with separate 20 min budgets? | split |
| Q12 | Learner Rust preprocessing (L15.1) reuses `tl-media` from L13.6, and Python decodes through `tinyllm_rs`. Does that coupling (Python preprocessing tests need the Rust farm and PyO3 build) fit the "Python is the semantic source of truth" principle, or should Python decode with a pure-Python PNG reader for tests and use `tinyllm_rs` only for JPEG? | `tinyllm_rs` for both |
