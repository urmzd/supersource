"""SQL corpus for ag.04 with the expected decision of every query.

    python course/oracle/ag.04/sql_corpus.py   # rewrites course/fixtures/ag.04/sql_corpus.json

The oracle is the Python classifier of case study 02
(case-studies/02-grounded-sql-agent/safety_gate.py), which the Go gate
ports: every expected (allowed, operation, cleared SQL) below is that
classifier's output, so the Go port is checked against an independent
implementation, not against itself. The corpus is the case study's ALLOWED
and BLOCKED lists plus queries over the usage ledger (formats/usage.v1.sql)
that the agent's query_usage tool will see.
