"""Maintainer generator for craft.08's seeded pull request.

craft.08 (code review) hands the learner a pull request against their own
system: a scratch copy of their repo whose `go/gateway/limit/limit.go` is the
course reference of gw.03 (markers dropped) plus a feature (evict idle keys)
written with five seeded defects (DESIGN 4.6, 5.10 `git-branch`). This script
writes the review material under course/mutants/craft.08/ from the CURRENT
gw.03 reference, so a change to that reference is one rerun away:

  pr.patch       reference -> the intended PR (correct): the eviction feature
                 in limit.go plus its test file idle_evict_test.go
  sNN.patch      intended PR -> intended PR with defect NN, one hunk each,
                 1 line of context, so the five apply in order without
                 touching each other (the PR head is all five)
  manifest.tsv   one row per defect; `line` is its first line in the PR head

and the reference review course/ref/docs/reviews/craft-08-pr-review.toml (one
finding per defect at its current line, the current head's blob), which
`ss verify course craft.08` grades in the reference learner.

Every edit below is an exact, unique string replacement on the reference, so
a drift in gw.03's reference fails loudly here instead of producing a
different PR. After writing, the script rebuilds the head by applying the
patches with `patch` (what the check does) and asserts it equals the head it
built in memory. course/tests/craft.08 then proves each defect is a real bug
(a Go test that passes on the intended PR and fails with that defect alone).
