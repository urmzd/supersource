"""Shared helper for the solve-key oracles (maintainer only, DESIGN 3.2 `oracle/`).

Each `course/oracle/solve/<S-ID>.py` recomputes every auto-checked answer of
`course/solve/<S-ID>/key.toml` by an independent route (enumeration, brute
force, numpy in the stated precision, SymPy differentiation of the actual
function) and hands the results to `confirm`, which:

  1. runs each recomputed value through the same checker `ss check` uses
     (`sscourse.solve_worker.check_one`), so it must pass the key, and
  2. fails when an auto-checked question has no recomputed value, so no key
     entry rests on the author's hand arithmetic alone.

Run from the worktree root:

    uv run --project course/harness python course/oracle/solve/S-M05.py
