"""Course tests for M06.2: the character trie (tinyllm/tok/trie.py).

Rung R0: read these before you write code. Each test names why it exists
(WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES,
mutants in course/mutants/M06.2), and the chapter section it comes from.

The chapter's worked example (section 3) is the trie of the five keys
un=1, unbe=2, unbeliev=3, able=4, a=5, matched against "unbelievable".
