"""Course tests for M10.1: gradient descent and Armijo line search (tinyllm/optim/gd.py).

Rung R0: read these before you write code. Each test names why it exists
(WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES,
mutants in course/mutants/M10.1), and the chapter section it comes from.

The worked example of the chapter (section 3) is
f(x) = (x1^2 + 10 x2^2) / 2 (L = 10, mu = 1, kappa = 10) from x0 = (10, 1)
with lr = 1/L: x1 = (9, 0), x2 = (8.1, 0), f = 55, 40.5, 32.805; and one
Armijo search on f(x) = x^2 at x = 1 along d = -2, which halves alpha
once and returns 0.5.
