"""craft.08 course tests: code review of a seeded pull request.

Annotated exemplars (DESIGN 5.12). The subject is a pull request against your
system: a scratch copy of your repo whose go/gateway/limit/limit.go is gw.03's
course reference plus an idle-key eviction feature written with five seeded
defects (DESIGN 4.6, 5.10). `check` builds it and fetches it into your repo as
branch drill/craft-08; these tests then grade your findings in
docs/reviews/craft-08-pr-review.toml against the hidden defect list
(course/mutants/craft.08).

The first three tests prove the pull request itself: it rebuilds from the
current reference, the intended change passes every proof, and each seeded
defect fails its proof alone, so every defect you are graded on is a real
bug. Go runs in its own process group with a timeout; your files are never
edited (the branch lives in your repo, its commits never touch your tree).
