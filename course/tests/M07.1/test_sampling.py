"""Course tests for M07.1: categorical sampling (tinyllm/prob/sampling.py).

Rung R0: read these before you write code. Each test names why it exists
(WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES,
mutants in course/mutants/M07.1), and the chapter section it comes from.

The chapter's worked example (section 3) is the 5-symbol distribution
p = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.0]. Statistical tests either enumerate a grid of
uniforms (exact) or draw from the frozen PCG32 at SS_SEED and apply a
chi-square test at p > 1e-3 (DESIGN 4.0, KIND statistical).
