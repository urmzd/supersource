"""The Hypothesis profile `ss` as a pytest plugin (DESIGN 5.9).

Course tests get the profile from course/tests/conftest.py. The learner's
graded tests run from their own directory, where that conftest is never
loaded, so `ss mutate`, `ss tdd`, and the mutation grade in `ss check` load
this module with `-p _lib.ss_hypothesis`: property tests are derandomized,
write no example database, and have no deadline, so a mutant is killed or
survives the same way on every run.
