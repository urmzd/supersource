"""lang.02 course tests: your Makefile for the two-file C program.

Annotated exemplars (DESIGN 5.12). Every test copies primers/lang.02 into a
fresh directory, so nothing here touches your repo. "Rebuilt" is measured by
modification times: the test pins every file's mtime to a known past moment,
runs make, and looks at which outputs got a new mtime.
