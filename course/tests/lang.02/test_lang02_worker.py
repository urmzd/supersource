"""lang.02 course tests: your worker script (primers/lang.02/worker.sh).

Annotated exemplars (DESIGN 5.12). Each test starts the script in its own
process group with a private state directory, waits for its `ready` line,
sends a signal, and reads the exit status. A process that exits by itself
with status 143 shows up as returncode 143; one the signal killed shows up as
-15 (Python's way of saying "terminated by signal 15").
