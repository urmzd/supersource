"""Course tests for M07.6: rejection sampling and residual distributions
(tinyllm/prob/rejection.py).

Rung R0: read these before you write code. Each test names why it exists
(WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES,
mutants in course/mutants/M07.6), and the chapter section it comes from.

The chapter's worked example (section 3) is p = [1/2, 1/4, 1/4, 0] and
q = [1/4, 1/2, 0, 1/4]. The statistical tests either enumerate grids of
uniforms on distributions whose probabilities are multiples of 1/8, where the
grid makes every acceptance count an exact integer (so the output
distribution is compared with p as exact fractions), or draw from the frozen
PCG32 at SS_SEED and apply a chi-square test at p > 1e-3 (DESIGN 4.0).
