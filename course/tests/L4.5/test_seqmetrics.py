"""Course tests for L4.5: sequence metrics (tinyllm/eval/seqmetrics.py).

Rung R0 reading for this file; your own tests are rung R5 (the chapter's
section 4). Each test names why it exists (WHY), what kind of check it is
(KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES, mutants in course/mutants/L4.5),
and the chapter section it comes from.

The chapter's worked examples (section 3):
  BLEU  hyp "the cat sat on the mat", ref "the cat is on the mat":
        clipped matches 5/6, 3/5, 1/4, 0/3; the 4-gram precision is smoothed
        to 1 / (2 * 3); BP = 1; BLEU = 100 * (1/48) ** (1/4) = 37.991784.
  chrF  hyp "cat", ref "cats": orders 1..3 have P = 1 and R = 3/4, 2/3, 1/2;
        orders 4..6 have no hypothesis n-gram; P = 1, R = 23/36,
        chrF = 100 * 5 P R / (4 P + R) = 100 * 115/167 = 68.862275.
  EM    "2021-05-03" vs itself, " 2021-05-04\\n" vs "2021-05-04" (strip),
        "2021-5-3" vs "2021-05-03": 2 of 3.

Golden values come from sacreBLEU 2.5.1 (course/fixtures/L4.5/sacrebleu_golden.json,
written by course/oracle/L4.5/sacrebleu_golden.py). Intervals use the frozen
PCG32.
