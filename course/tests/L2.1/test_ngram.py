"""Course tests for L2.1: NGramLM, interpolated modified Kneser-Ney
(tinyllm/lm/ngram.py).

Rung R0 for these course tests (your own graded tests are rung R3: write
them first, see the chapter's "How to work this chapter"). Each test names
why it exists (WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it
kills (CATCHES, mutants in course/mutants/L2.1), and the chapter section it
comes from.

The chapter's worked example (section 3) is the corpus a b c / a b a b /
c a b c over V = 3 tokens (a = 0, b = 1, c = 2), a bigram model with a
fixed discount d = 1/2. b is the most frequent token after a but follows
nothing else, so its continuation count is 1 and the unigram level gives it
1/6, not the 4/11 raw counts would. The golden values in
$TINYLLM_FIXTURES/L2.1/kn_golden.json come from an independent exact
(fractions.Fraction) implementation, course/oracle/L2.1/kn_golden.py, on
that corpus and on the bytes of course/fixtures/MS-P1/corpus.txt.
