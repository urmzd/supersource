"""ethics.01 artifact checks: your data licensing policy and allowlist.

Run by `ss check ethics.01` (through ./check) from the root of your repo,
which `check` passes as SS_REPO. Annotated exemplars (DESIGN 5.12): every
test says why it exists and fails with a message that says what to change.

The formats are the chapter's (responsible-ai/01-data-licensing/
01-data-licensing-and-the-ledger.md, section 4):

    docs/data/LICENSE_POLICY.md          the policy, in prose, with fixed `##` sections
    docs/data/license-allowlist.toml     the machine-readable allowlist data.08 enforces

This is an engineering check of a written decision, not legal advice: it
checks that every decision is recorded, uses SPDX identifiers, and respects
the few rules the course fixes (section 2.4), not that a lawyer would agree.
