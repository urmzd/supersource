"""craft.06 course tests: grading YOUR benchmark and performance gate (rung R7).

Annotated exemplars (DESIGN 5.12). A gate is graded by what it catches
(DESIGN 5.6): your primers/craft.06/gate.py, with your bench.c and
budget.toml, compares a base kernels.c with a head kernels.c. Here the base
is always the course's kata and the head is, in turn, the course's kata
(no false alarm), your kata (it keeps pace), and the course's kata with one
planted slowdown from course/mutants/craft.06 (each must fail the gate).
Every build and run happens in a scratch directory, in its own process
group, with a timeout. Nothing here edits your files.

The worked example of the chapter (section 3): base 8.0 ms, head 9.6 ms is
+20%, inside a 25% budget; head 16.0 ms (twice the work) is +100% and
regresses; exactly +25% (10.0 ms) is still allowed.
