"""craft.01 course tests: your CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml).

Annotated exemplars (DESIGN 5.12). These read the workflow statically: they
cannot run GitHub Actions, so they check the three gates are present and
wired the way that makes each one actually catch something. Whether the
workflow is green on your default branch is MS-P0's `ci-status` step.
