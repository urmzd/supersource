"""craft.01 course tests: your commit-msg hook (.githooks/commit-msg).

Annotated exemplars (DESIGN 5.12). The hook is graded by what it accepts and
what it rejects: a table of messages, each with the reason it is in the table.
Its verdicts must agree with the pattern MS-P0's `git-log` matcher applies to
your HEAD, so a commit your hook lets through also passes the milestone.
