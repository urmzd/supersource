"""Course tests for M06.1: toposort (tinyllm/autograd/graph.py).

Rung R0: read these before you write code. Each test names why it exists
(WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES,
mutants in course/mutants/M06.1), and the chapter section it comes from.

The chapter's worked example (section 3) is the graph of
    L = (x * y) + (x + c)      named nodes: L, m = x * y, s = x + c, x, y, c
with parents(L) = [m, s], parents(m) = [x, y], parents(s) = [x, c].
