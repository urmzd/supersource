"""Course tests for M05.2: finite functions and the GPT-2 byte map
(tinyllm/tok/bytes_unicode.py).

Rung R0: read these before you write code. Each test names why it exists
(WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES,
mutants in course/mutants/M05.2), and the chapter section it comes from.

The chapter's worked example (section 3) encodes the bytes of "Hi there\\n"
as "HiĠthereĊ" and checks three small maps by hand.
