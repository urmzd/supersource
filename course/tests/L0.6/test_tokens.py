"""Course tests for L0.6: the token-stream reader (tinyllm/io/tokens.py).

Rung R0: read these before you write code. Each test names why it exists
(WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES,
mutants in course/mutants/L0.6), and the chapter section it comes from.

The worked example of the chapter (section 3): one shard holding the ids
10, 11, ..., 19 (n = 10), seq_len T = 3, batch B = 2, and a generator whose
phase draws come out 1, then 0. Pass 1 starts at offset 1: windows at 1 and
4 (the next, at 7, would need ids up to 10). Batch 1 is inputs
[[11, 12, 13], [14, 15, 16]], targets [[12, 13, 14], [15, 16, 17]]. Batch 2
starts pass 2 at phase 0: windows at 0 and 3, inputs [[10, 11, 12],
[13, 14, 15]]; the cursor is then {shard 0, offset 6}. Each phase is drawn
with below(min(T, n - T)) = below(3).
