"""Course tests for M07.4: LLN, CLT, confidence intervals, and the bootstrap
(tinyllm/prob/stats.py).

Rung R0: read these before you write code. Each test names why it exists
(WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES,
mutants in course/mutants/M07.4), and the chapter section it comes from.

The chapter's worked example (section 3): x = [2, 4, 4, 5, 7, 8] has mean 5,
squared deviations summing to 24, s^2 = 24 / 5, standard error
sqrt(4.8 / 6) = 0.894427, t_{0.975, 5} = 2.570582, so the 95% interval is
[2.700802, 7.299198]; t_cdf(1, 3) = 1/2 + 1/6 + sqrt(3) / (4 pi) = 0.804499;
and the Wilson interval for 0 successes in 10 trials is [0, 0.277533].

Golden values come from scipy 1.17.1 (course/fixtures/M07.4/scipy_golden.json,
written by course/oracle/M07.4/scipy_golden.py). Statistical tests draw from
the frozen PCG32 at SS_SEED.
