"""Course tests for M08.4: Hessian-vector products and checkpoint schedules
(tinyllm/autograd/hvp.py).

Rung R0: read these before you write code. Each test names why it exists
(WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES,
mutants in course/mutants/M08.4), and the chapter section it comes from.

The worked examples of the chapter (section 3): the quartic f(x) = x^4 / 24
at x = 1 with v = 1 and eps = 0.1 (exact H v = 1/2, central difference
0.5016667, error eps^2 / 6), and the schedules of a 6-layer stack.

Two golden tests compare with torch's double backward on the mean softmax
cross-entropy of a linear model. Its gradient, X^T (softmax(X W) - onehot) / n,
is M08.3's cross-entropy VJP written out here, so these tests call no other
module.
