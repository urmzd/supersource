"""Course tests for L0.5's take-over of tinyllm/lm/bigram.py: BigramLogits,
the autograd-trained bigram, and PCG32 sampling.

L0.0's tests still run against this file as L0.5's regression suite (the
count model, the C logits, the safetensors bytes): taking a unit over keeps
its contract.

The worked example of the chapter (section 3, second half): BigramLogits(3)
starts at zeros, so every next token has probability 1/3 and the NLL of any
text is ln 3. On the text "abbacab" the gradient of the mean NLL with
respect to row a (three predictions from a: b, c, b) is
(3 * [1/3, 1/3, 1/3] - [0, 2, 1]) / 6 = [1/6, -1/6, 0].
