"""obs.00 artifact check: one request is one trace, gateway.proxy -> POST /v1/completions.

Run by `ss check obs.00` in your repo. Two tiers:

  local    your [build] steps, then your engine and gateway started from system.toml
           as local processes (as `ss milestone MS-P1 --smoke` does) with
           OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT pointing at a course OTLP sink. One streamed
           request must produce the gateway's CLIENT span `gateway.proxy` and, as its
           child in the same trace, the engine's SERVER span `POST /v1/completions`.
  cluster  on [deploy].kube_context: a request through [deploy].gateway_url shows
           up in Jaeger ([deploy].traces) as one trace across <system>-gateway and
           <system>-engine.

The cluster tier fails when the context is missing or down; with SS_SMOKE=1 it is
skipped with the reason instead.
