"""Course tests for L8.1: sampling and logit processors
(tinyllm/infer/sample.py, spec/sampling.md).

Rung R0 for the course suite: read these before you write code. Each test
names why it exists (WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs
it kills (CATCHES, mutants in course/mutants/L8.1), and the chapter section
it comes from. You write your own graded tests too (rung R5, see the
chapter).

The worked example is the spec's: V = 5, x = [1, 3, 2, 3, -1], top_k = 3,
top_p = 0.8, seed 0, which samples id 3 with logprob -0.92487. The golden
fixture course/fixtures/L8.1/sampler_golden.json comes from an independent
stdlib transcription of the spec (course/oracle/L8.1/sampler_golden.py) and
is the same file the Rust port (L10.1) is held to. Expected generators are
built from the frozen PCG32.
