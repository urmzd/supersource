"""Course tests for L11.2 (optional): collectives over processes
(tinyllm/dist/comm.py).

Rung R0 reading for the course tests; your own graded tests (rung R5) go in
python/tests/l11-2-comm/. Each test names why it exists (WHY), what kind of
check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES, mutants in
course/mutants/L11.2), and the chapter section it comes from.

The worked example of the chapter (section 3): three ranks holding
[1, 2, 3], [10, 20, 30], [100, 200, 300], reduced on a ring to
[111, 222, 333] with 32 bytes sent per rank.

Every test runs real processes through your spawn; the workers are
module-level functions (the "spawn" start method pickles them by name), and
every spawn has a timeout, so a deadlock fails the test instead of hanging.
