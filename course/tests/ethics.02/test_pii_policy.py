"""ethics.02 artifact checks: your privacy and PII policy.

Run by `ss check ethics.02` (through ./check) from the root of your repo,
which `check` passes as SS_REPO. Annotated exemplars (DESIGN 5.12).

The formats are the chapter's (responsible-ai/02-privacy-and-pii/
01-privacy-and-pii-policy.md, section 4):

    docs/data/PII_POLICY.md       the policy, with fixed `##` sections
    docs/data/pii-policy.toml     categories, actions, placeholders, audit, logs
    docs/data/pii-review.toml     your answers to the twelve review cases

The categories are the five kinds data.05 detects (contracts/py/corpus/
pii.pyi KINDS) and gw.08 redacts from logs: email, phone, card (Luhn-valid
numbers only), ip (IPv4 and IPv6), key (API-key shapes), each replaced by
its data.05 placeholder.
