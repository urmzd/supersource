"""Course tests for ethics.04: bias and safety evals (tinyllm/eval/safety.py,
tinyllm/eval/bias.py).

Rung R0 reading for the course tests; your own graded tests (rung R5) go in
python/tests/ethics-04-evals/. Each test names why it exists (WHY), what
kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES, mutants in
course/mutants/ethics.04), and the chapter section it comes from.

The worked examples of the chapter (section 3): the toxicity of
"I hate you, you idiot!" (0.98), a refusal rate of 3 in 4 with its Wilson
interval, and the gender gap of a scorer that only counts characters (0.1).

The models here are fakes with known answers: a generator driven by the
frozen PCG32 and score functions written out in the test. Fixtures:
course/fixtures/ethics.04/ (hand-written lexicon, labelled texts, red-team
prompts, bias templates).
