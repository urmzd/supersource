"""Course tests for M07.2: estimating a distribution from counts
(tinyllm/prob/mle.py).

Rung R0: read these before you write code. Each test names why it exists
(WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES,
mutants in course/mutants/M07.2), and the chapter section it comes from.

The chapter's worked example (section 3) counts a = 3, b = 2, c = 1, d = 0
over the five-word vocabulary a, b, c, d, e (e is never a key). Every
expected value in this file is an exact fraction worked out by hand.
