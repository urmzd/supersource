"""Course tests for M06.3: tinyllm/num/rng.py against
spec/pcg32.md.

Rung R0: read these before you write code. Each test names why it exists
(WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES,
mutants in course/mutants/M06.3), and the chapter section it comes from.

The reference vectors are a copy of contracts/spec/pcg32.vectors.json
(fixture course/fixtures/M06.3/pcg32.vectors.json, rebuilt from the spec by
course/oracle/M06.3/vectors.py). Rust and Go ports consume the same frozen
vectors through their own process-based conformance drivers.
