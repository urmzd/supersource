"""Course tests for M03.3: qr_householder and orthogonal_init
(tinyllm/linalg/qr.py).

Rung R0: read these before you write code. Each test names why it exists
(WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES,
mutants in course/mutants/M03.3), and the chapter section it comes from.

The chapter's worked example (section 3) is A = [[3, 1], [4, 2]]: one
reflection gives Q = [[0.6, -0.8], [0.8, 0.6]] and R = [[5, 2.2], [0, 0.4]].
numpy's LAPACK QR is the oracle for random matrices, compared after the same
sign rule (diagonal of R non-negative).
