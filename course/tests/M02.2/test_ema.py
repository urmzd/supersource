"""Course tests for M02.2: series convergence, the EMA as a geometric series,
and bias correction (tinyllm/num/ema.py).

Rung R0: read these before you write code. Each test names why it exists
(WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES,
mutants in course/mutants/M02.2), and the chapter section it comes from.

The worked example of the chapter (section 3) is beta = 0.9 and the inputs
1, 2, 3: m = 0.1, 0.29, 0.561, the weight totals 1 - 0.9^t = 0.1, 0.19,
0.271, and the debiased values 1, 1.5263158, 2.0701107.
