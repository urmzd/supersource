"""Course tests for M07.5: hypothesis tests, paired and two-sample permutation,
McNemar, Holm (tinyllm/prob/tests.py).

Rung R0: read these before you write code. Each test names why it exists
(WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES,
mutants in course/mutants/M07.5), and the chapter section it comes from.

The chapter's worked example (section 3): model B minus model A on three
prompts is d = (2, 1, 3). Of the 2^3 = 8 sign patterns, two reach
|sum| = 6, so the exact p-value is 2/8 = 1/4, and the add-one estimate over
the same 8 patterns is (1 + 2) / (1 + 8) = 1/3. McNemar with b01 = 1 and
b10 = 7: 2 * (C(8,0) + C(8,1)) / 2^8 = 18/256 = 9/128 = 0.0703125. Holm on
(0.01, 0.04, 0.02, 0.005) at alpha 0.05 rejects all four (Bonferroni only two),
and the adjusted p-values are (0.03, 0.04, 0.04, 0.02).

Golden values come from scipy 1.17.1 (course/fixtures/M07.5/scipy_golden.json,
written by course/oracle/M07.5/scipy_golden.py). Statistical tests draw from
the frozen PCG32 at SS_SEED.
