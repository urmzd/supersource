"""Course tests for M01.1: finite-difference derivatives (tinyllm/num/diff.py).

Rung R0: read these before you write code. Each test names why it exists
(WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES,
mutants in course/mutants/M01.1), and the chapter section it comes from.

The worked example of the chapter (section 3) is f(x) = x**3 at x = 2 with
h = 0.1: forward 12.61, central 12.01, one Richardson level 12, true 12.
