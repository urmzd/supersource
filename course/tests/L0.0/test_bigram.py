"""Course tests for L0.0: the byte-level bigram model (tinyllm/lm/bigram.py).

Rung R0: read these before you write code. Each test names why it exists
(WHY), what kind of check it is (KIND), the planted bugs it kills (CATCHES,
mutants in course/mutants/L0.0), and the chapter section it comes from.

The worked example of the chapter (section 3) is a three-symbol alphabet
a, b, c with ids 0, 1, 2 and the text "abbacab", ids [0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1].
