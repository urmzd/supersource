"""craft.03 course tests: the grade of YOUR tests, primers/craft.03/test_failpoints.py.

This is mutation testing (DESIGN 5.6) in miniature, the same procedure
`ss check` and `ss mutate` apply to your graded tests from L0.3 on:

  1. your tests pass against your own kata (green);
  2. your tests pass against the course's kata (they do not reject a correct
     implementation);
  3. for each planted fault in course/mutants/craft.03 (one at a time, a
     patch of the course's kata), your tests must FAIL: the fault is
     killed. The score is killed / total; you pass with at least 0.70 and
     the fault marked required killed (rung R3).

A surviving fault is shown by its public description, or as "a planted bug
from Pitfall N survived" for a semantic one. Each run is a fresh pytest
process in its own process group, one at a time, with a 60 s limit.
