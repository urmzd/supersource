"""ethics.03 artifact checks: your model card, datasheet, and third-party
model card.

Run by `ss check ethics.03` (through ./check) from the root of your repo,
which `check` passes as SS_REPO. Annotated exemplars (DESIGN 5.12): every
test says why it exists and fails with a message that says what to change.

The files and their sections are the chapter's (responsible-ai/
03-model-and-data-cards/01-datasheet-and-model-card.md, section 4):

    docs/MODEL_CARD.md                       from contracts/templates/MODEL_CARD.md
    docs/DATASHEET.md                        from contracts/templates/DATASHEET.md
    docs/models/smollm2-135m-instruct.md     the third-party model, labelled as such

A check can tell that a card is complete, specific, and consistent with
your other records; it cannot tell that it is true. That part is yours.
