"""craft.03 kata: the failpoint spec (a primer exercise you then reuse).

TL_FAILPOINTS names places in a program where a test wants something to go
wrong, and what:

    TL_FAILPOINTS="train/after-step=60*crash; data/fetch=error(timeout); x=sleep(50ms)"

Your CLI evaluates `train/after-step` after every optimizer step (MS-L0 kills
a training run that way). This kata is the pure part: parse the spec and
decide, evaluation by evaluation, whether a failpoint fires. What a fired
rule does (exit 137, raise, sleep) stays with the caller.

The spec (the course testkits' grammar, without the probability form):

    spec    := entry (";" entry)*        empty entries are skipped
    entry   := name "=" [N "*"] action   whitespace around name, N, action is ignored
    action  := "crash" | "panic" | "off" | "error" ["(" msg ")"] | "sleep" "(" duration ")"
    duration:= digits ["." digits] ("ms" | "s")

`N*` (N >= 1) fires on the Nth evaluation of that name only; without it the
rule fires on every evaluation. `off` never fires and is never counted.
