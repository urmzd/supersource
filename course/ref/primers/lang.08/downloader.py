"""lang.08 bounded concurrent downloader (a primer exercise, not part of the system).

Four pieces, each one asyncio idea:

    http_get       one HTTP/1.1 GET over asyncio streams (coroutines, await)
    fetch          retries with exponential backoff and a per-attempt timeout
    download_all   many fetches at once, at most `limit` in flight (tasks,
                   TaskGroup, Semaphore), cancelling the rest on a failure

Standard library only. The corpus fetcher (data.01) is built from the same
pieces, plus resume and checksums.
