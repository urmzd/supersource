"""craft.04 kata: two text operations whose laws you test with properties.

1. `normalize(text)`, the shape of the corpus normalizer (data.02 builds the
   real one): Unicode NFC, one line-ending convention, one space between
   words, at most one blank line between paragraphs, nothing at either end.
   Its law is IDEMPOTENCE: normalize(normalize(x)) == normalize(x). A
   pipeline that reruns a stage (a retried activity, a resumed run) must get
   the same bytes the second time.

2. `MiniBPE`, a byte-level BPE with a fixed merge list (the shape of L1.2
   and L1.5 without a pre-tokenizer). Its law is the ROUNDTRIP:
   decode(encode(x)) == x for every string x. Roundtrip alone is weak: a BPE
   that merges nothing also round-trips. The chapter's other properties
   (fixpoint, agreement with a model) catch the rest.

The rules, exactly (the planted faults break one each):

normalize(text):
    a. NFC (unicodedata.normalize("NFC", text)).
    b. "\\r\\n" and lone "\\r" become "\\n".
    c. Within each line, every run of horizontal white space (any character
       with str.isspace() other than "\\n") becomes one " ", and each line is
       stripped of spaces at both ends.
    d. Runs of 3 or more "\\n" become exactly "\\n\\n".
    e. The result is stripped of white space at both ends.

MiniBPE(merges): merges[r] = (a, b) creates id 256 + r from ids a and b;
ids 0 to 255 are the bytes. encode(text) takes the UTF-8 bytes and merges
repeatedly: the adjacent pair with the lowest rank, the leftmost on ties,
until no adjacent pair has a merge. decode_bytes(ids) expands every id to
its bytes; decode(ids) is decode_bytes(ids) decoded as UTF-8 with
replacement (errors="replace"). An id outside 0 .. 255 + len(merges) is a
ValueError.
