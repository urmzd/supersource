/* c/src/ds/lru.c (ds.03): least-recently-used order over intrusive nodes.
 * Contract: tinyllm/ds.h (ds.03 section).
 *
 * The policy is one rule: every use of an element moves its node to the
 * most recent end (head.prev); eviction takes the node at the oldest end
 * (head.next, tl_lru_pop_oldest in list.c). Both ends are O(1) because the
 * node is inside the element: finding it costs nothing, and moving it is
 * an unlink plus a link. rt.04 keeps its cached KV blocks on one tl_lru.
