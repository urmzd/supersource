"""corpus.stage (data.02): the Doc type, streaming stages, and extraction.

Every corpus stage is a function from an iterator of documents to an
iterator of documents, so a pipeline is just function composition and
memory stays flat whatever the corpus size: a stage pulls one document,
yields zero or one (or more), and never holds the stream.

    pipeline = compose(normalize_unicode, lang_filter(0.65), gopher_rules())
    for doc in pipeline(extract(manifest)): ...
