"""tinyllm.autograd.graph (M06.1): the order backward walks a computation graph.

A computation graph is a DAG: every node is a value and `parents(node)` lists
the values it was computed from. Backward starts at the loss (the root) and
must reach a node only after every node that used it, so the node's gradient
is complete before it is passed on. That order is a reverse topological order.

    order = toposort(loss, lambda t: t._parents)   # loss first, leaves last
