"""tinyllm.info.pmi (M11.4): mutual information, pointwise mutual
information, and positive PMI.

Mutual information I(X; Y) is how many nats knowing X saves you about Y: the
KL divergence from the joint distribution to the product of its marginals,
zero exactly when the two are independent. Pointwise mutual information is
the log ratio inside that sum for one pair, log P(w, c) / (P(w) P(c)):
positive when w and c occur together more often than chance. Clipping it at
zero (PPMI) gives the classic count-based word vectors that L2.3 factors
with an SVD, the baseline that word2vec is compared with.
