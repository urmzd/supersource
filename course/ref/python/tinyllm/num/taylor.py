"""Taylor series, remainder bounds, and range reduction (M02.1).

A truncated Taylor series is a polynomial, and a polynomial is all a CPU can
evaluate: additions and multiplications. The Lagrange remainder says how
far the polynomial is from the function, and it is small only near the
expansion point. Range reduction moves every input there first:
exp(x) = 2**k exp(r) with |r| <= ln(2) / 2. The polynomial is evaluated with
M00.4's horner. M09.6 ports exp_range_reduced to C as tl_expf; M01.3's
gelu_erf calls erf_series.
