"""Polynomials, Horner's rule, and stable quadratic roots (M00.4).

A polynomial p(x) = c[0] + c[1] x + ... + c[n] x^n is stored by its
coefficients in ASCENDING order of power. Horner's rule evaluates it as
c[0] + x (c[1] + x (c[2] + ... + x c[n])) with n multiplications and n
additions. M02.1 evaluates Taylor polynomials with it, and M09.6 runs the
same loop in C inside tl_expf.
