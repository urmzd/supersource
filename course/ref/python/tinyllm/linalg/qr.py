"""tinyllm.linalg.qr (M03.3): QR by Householder reflections, and the
orthogonal initializer that L0.4 and the recurrent layers use.

A Householder reflection H = I - 2 v v^T (with ||v|| = 1) mirrors space
across the hyperplane orthogonal to v. Choosing v so that H maps the part of
column j below the diagonal onto a multiple of e_1 zeroes that column; doing
this for every column turns A into R, and the product of the reflections is
Q^T. Reflections are orthogonal by construction, so Q stays orthogonal to
working precision however ill-conditioned A is (Gram-Schmidt does not).
