"""Activation checkpointing (L11.1).

`checkpoint` runs a function without recording its graph and keeps only its
inputs; the node it returns reruns the function with the graph on when the
backward pass reaches it. Replaying each random generator from the state it
had in the forward pass makes the rerun draw the same dropout masks, so the
gradients are bit for bit those of the plain run. `checkpoint_sequential`
applies M08.4's schedule to a stack of layers.
