## Maintenance

The owner of each service updates its runbook when an alert, command, threshold, or recovery step changes. The docs owner updates the tutorial and reference links with the same pull request that changes the corresponding contract. Review links in CI and check every command in a disposable environment before approving an operational procedure.
