# contracts/py/corpus/ledger.pyi (data.08): licensing ledger verification
# and the datasheet
# chapter: data-engineering/05-corpus-pipeline/08-ledger-and-datasheet.md
#
# The ledger is corpus/LEDGER.jsonl, one formats/ledger.schema.json object
# per line, append-only: data.01 appends a row per fetched source, and
# reconcile() appends corrected rows. The LAST row of a source_id is its
# current state.
#
# Licenses. ALLOWLIST maps an SPDX license id to the uses it permits
# ("train", "eval"); the policy is ethics.01's. An expression joins ids
# with OR (the licensee may pick: the union of the uses) or AND (both
# apply: the intersection), evaluated left to right with AND binding
# tighter; anything else (parentheses, WITH, an id outside ALLOWLIST) is
# unknown.
#
# Exit code. A failed verification is EX_DATAERR = 65: non-retryable under
# spec/subprocess-activity.md, so a CorpusBuild with a bad license fails
# once instead of retrying forever (the CLI exits with LedgerError.exit_code).
