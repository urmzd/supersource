# contracts/py/corpus/shard.pyi (data.06): Parquet shards, the manifest, and
# the document-hash train/val split
# chapter: data-engineering/05-corpus-pipeline/06-parquet-shards-and-manifest.md
#
# The files are fixed by formats/corpus-shard.md and
# formats/corpus-manifest.schema.json; this module writes and reads them
# with pyarrow (allowed for `corpus` in allowed-deps.toml).
#
# Rows. One row per document, columns in SCHEMA order:
#   id, text, source_id      the Doc's fields
#   url, license_spdx        meta["url"], meta["license_spdx"] (KeyError
#                            surfaces as ValueError naming the document)
#   lang                     meta.get("lang", "und")
#   n_chars                  len(text) in code points
#   sha256                   SHA-256 of text's UTF-8 bytes (32 raw bytes)
#   minhash_cluster          rows sharing meta["minhash_cluster"] (data.04;
#                            a document without it is its own cluster) form
#                            one cluster; its value is the smallest row
#                            index (global, 0-based, in output order) of
#                            the cluster's rows
#   pii_redactions           meta.get("pii_redactions", 0) (data.05)
#   split                    split_of(sha256, val_permille)
#
# Order and files. Rows are sorted by id (Python str order, which is UTF-8
# byte order) and cut into shards of shard_rows rows; n = max(1,
# ceil(n_docs / shard_rows)) shards named shard_name(i, n), so an empty
# corpus still has one (empty) shard. Inside a shard, a row group holds
# consecutive rows whose UTF-8 text bytes sum to at most row_group_bytes (a
# longer document gets a group of its own). Compression zstd.
#
# Manifest. _MANIFEST.json, keys in this order: dataset, version, n_docs,
# n_shards, shards [{name, sha256 (of the file bytes), rows}], filters,
# dedup {exact_dropped, near_dropped, decontaminated, jaccard_threshold,
# num_perm, bands, ngram}, pii {emails, phones, cards, ips, keys} (summed
# from each document's data.05 manifest_counts(meta["pii"])), ledger_ref,
# config_sha256; written as json.dumps(m, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)
# plus "\n". Every file is byte-identical for the same input, whatever the
# input order.
#
# Atomicity. Everything is written under out + ".tmp" (removed first if a
# crashed run left it) and renamed to out at the end, replacing an older out.
