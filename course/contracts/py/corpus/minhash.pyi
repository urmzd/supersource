#
# Shingles. words(text) is re.findall(r"\w+", text.lower()): Unicode word
# runs, lower-cased. A k-shingle is k consecutive words joined by one space.
# A text with 1 to k-1 words has one shingle (all its words); a text with no
# words has none, and is never anyone's near duplicate.
#
# Hashing (M06.3). P = MERSENNE31 = 2^31 - 1, a prime. A shingle s hashes to
# x(s) = fnv1a64(utf8(s)) mod P. Permutation i is h_i(x) = (a_i * x + b_i)
# mod P with, from one PCG32(seed) in this order, a_0 = 1 + below(P - 1),
# b_0 = below(P), a_1, b_1, ... (a and b interleaved). Every product fits in
# uint64 (a, x < 2^31), so numpy computes it exactly.
#
# Signature. sig_i = min over the shingles of h_i(x); a text without
# shingles has sig_i = P for every i (P is never a hash value).
# Pr[sig_i(A) = sig_i(B)] is the Jaccard similarity |A n B| / |A u B|, so
# the share of equal entries estimates it without bias.
#
# LSH. b bands of r rows (b * r = num_perm). Two keys are candidates when
# all r entries of at least one band are equal: probability
# 1 - (1 - s^r)^b at similarity s, an S-curve whose steep part sits near
# (1/b)^(1/r). Candidates are confirmed by the estimate (>= threshold) and
# merged by union-find; the root of a cluster is its smallest id (byte
# order), so the output never depends on the order of unions.
#
# Determinism. Results do not depend on `workers` (signatures are computed
# in contiguous chunks on a process pool, every chunk with the same
# parameters) or on the order of the input.
#
# Decontamination. The protected n-grams are the word n-grams (n = 13 by
# default, words() as above) of every protected text. A protected file is
# JSON Lines when its name ends in .jsonl (each line an object; its texts
# are every string value, recursively, except under the keys "case_id",
# "id", "tags", and "scorer_args"), otherwise one UTF-8 text. A document is
# contaminated when one of its word n-grams is protected; texts with fewer
# than n words have no n-grams.
