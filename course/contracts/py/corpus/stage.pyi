# contracts/py/corpus/stage.pyi (data.02): the Doc type, streaming stages, extraction
# chapter: data-engineering/05-corpus-pipeline/02-extract-normalize-and-quality-filters.md
#
# Every corpus stage (data.02 to data.05) is a Stage: a function from an
# iterator of Docs to an iterator of Docs. A stage pulls documents one at a
# time and yields as it goes; it never collects the stream (a list, a sort,
# a len), so a pipeline runs in constant memory on any corpus size. Doc is
# immutable: a stage that changes a document yields a new one
# (dataclasses.replace) and never mutates `meta` in place.
#
# meta keys set so far: url, fetched_at, license_spdx (extract); lang and
# lang_conf (corpus.filter.lang_filter); ppl (corpus.filter.ppl_filter).
