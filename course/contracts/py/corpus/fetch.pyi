# contracts/py/corpus/fetch.pyi (data.01): async fetch with resume, checksums, license capture
# chapter: data-engineering/05-corpus-pipeline/01-async-fetch-resume-checksums.md
#
# Input: the `sources` of a corpus config (formats/corpus-config.schema.json).
# Output under `dest` (the corpus directory, /artifacts/corpus):
#
#   raw/<source_id>/<yyyymmdd>/part-<nnnnn>.jsonl.zst   raw documents (formats/corpus-shard.md)
#   LEDGER.jsonl                                         one row per fetched source (formats/ledger.schema.json)
#   quarantine/<source_id>/<name>                        bytes whose sha256 is not the pinned one
#   downloads/<source_id>/<name>[.part]                  downloads, kept so a cut one resumes
#
# Words used below:
#   pinned     the sha256 the config gives for a source; the only checksum
#              trusted (a server's own checksum header is not)
#   retryable  a failure a later attempt may not see: HTTP 5xx and 429, a body
#              cut short, a reset or refused connection, no byte for
#              `timeout` seconds. Anything else (other 4xx, a malformed
#              response, a file that is not UTF-8 text or JSON Lines) is not.
#   <line>     the 1-based line where a document starts in its source file
#
# A raw document line is {"url": "<source url>#<line>", "fetched_at":
# <retrieved_at>, "license_spdx": <source license>, "text": <document>},
# written as compact JSON in that key order, non-ASCII kept as UTF-8. Parts
# hold at most `part_docs` documents and are zstd frames (zstandard, level 3).
