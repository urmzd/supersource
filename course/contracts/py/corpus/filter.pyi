# contracts/py/corpus/filter.pyi (data.02): normalization and quality filters, each a Stage
# chapter: data-engineering/05-corpus-pipeline/02-extract-normalize-and-quality-filters.md
#
# Words used below:
#   words       text.split(): maximal runs of non-white-space characters
#   letters     characters c with c.isalpha()
#   lang words  maximal runs of letters in text.lower() (regex [^\W\d_]+)
#   line        a piece of text.split("\n"); blank when it is white space only
#
# The thresholds' names are the keys of the corpus config's `filters` table
# (formats/corpus-config.schema.json); its `gopher` table uses the keyword
# names of gopher_reasons.
