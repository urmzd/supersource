# contracts/py/corpus/tokenize.pyi (data.07): tokenize the shards and pack
# llm.c .bin token streams
# chapter: data-engineering/05-corpus-pipeline/07-tokenize-and-pack.md
#
# Files: formats/tokens-bin.md (a 1024-byte header of 256 little-endian
# int32 [20240520, version, n_tokens, vocab_size, 0...], then the ids,
# uint16 for version 1, uint32 for version 2) and
# formats/tokens-manifest.schema.json.
#
# Tokenizers. tokenizer_json None is the byte tokenizer (D32: id = UTF-8
# byte, vocab_size 256, no separator, tokenizer_sha256 of b""). Otherwise
# the file loads through Python BPETokenizer (L1.2/L1.5) and documents are
# encoded with no special tokens added.
#
# Separator. doc_sep_id when given; else the int eos_token_id of
# generation_config.json in tokenizer_json's directory when that file
# exists; else none. With a separator every document is PRECEDED by it.
#
# Packing. For each split ("train", then "val") the documents of that split
# are read with corpus.shard.read_shards (data.06) in manifest order and
# appended to <split>-00000.bin; a document that would push the current
# file past max_file_tokens starts the next file (-00001, ...), so a file
# holds whole documents (one longer document fills a file alone). Every
# split gets at least its -00000 file, possibly with no tokens. Version 1
# when vocab_size <= 65536, else 2.
#
# Manifest. out/_MANIFEST.json with the schema's keys in its order
# (tokenizer_id, tokenizer_sha256, vocab_size, doc_sep_id, dataset, version,
# corpus_manifest_sha256, files [{name, split, n_tokens, n_docs, sha256}]),
# files sorted by name, written as json.dumps(m, indent=2) plus "\n".
# Output is byte-identical across runs. Written under out + ".tmp" and
# renamed, like data.06.
