# contracts/py/corpus/dedup.pyi (data.03): exact dedup by paragraph hashes, Bloom screen, sort-merge confirm
# chapter: data-engineering/05-corpus-pipeline/03-exact-dedup-bloom-and-sort-merge.md
#
# Words used below:
#   paragraph   a piece of a text between blank lines (a line that is empty
#               or holds only spaces and tabs), stripped; empty pieces skipped
#   repeat      an occurrence of a paragraph whose exact text (its
#               paragraph_hash) occurred earlier: in an earlier document, or
#               earlier in the same document
#
# data.03 uses a private Python Bloom screen. Its positives are candidates
# only: a paragraph is removed only when a second occurrence of its exact
# hash is confirmed.
