# contracts/py/corpus/pii.pyi (data.05): PII scrub with typed placeholders
# and audit spans
# chapter: data-engineering/05-corpus-pipeline/05-pii-scrub.md
#
# Five detectors, each a candidate regex plus a validator. Offsets are
# Python str indexes (code points) into the text the detector was given.
#
#   email  local@domain.tld: local [A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+, dot-separated domain
#          labels [A-Za-z0-9-], a final label of 2+ letters; not preceded by
#          [\w.+-], not followed by [\w-]
#   phone  North American (+1 optional; (212) 555-0123, 212-555-0123,
#          212.555.0123, 212 555 0123), or international: "+" then 8 to 15
#          digits in total, optionally in groups split by single spaces,
#          dots, or dashes; not inside a longer run of digits or word chars
#   card   13 to 19 digits, optionally split by single spaces or dashes,
#          first digit 2 to 6 (card networks; ISBN-13 starts 978 or 979),
#          and Luhn-valid
#   ip     IPv4 dotted quad, each octet 0 to 255, not part of a longer
#          dotted run (so 1.2.3.4.5 and v1.2.3.4 are not addresses); IPv6
#          that ipaddress.IPv6Address accepts, with at least two non-empty
#          groups and four hex digits in total (so 1::2 in a slice and ::1
#          are not)
#   key    API-key shapes: sk-... (20+ chars after the prefix, sk-proj- and
#          sk-ant- included), AKIA + 16 [0-9A-Z], gh[pousr]_ + 36 alnum,
#          xox[abprs]- + 10+ [A-Za-z0-9-], AIza + 35 [0-9A-Za-z_-], and the
#          course's own tl_<id>_<secret> (id [a-z0-9]{4,32}, secret 24+
#          alnum, D19); not preceded or followed by [\w-]
#
# Overlaps resolve left to right: among candidates that overlap, the one
# that starts first wins, then the longer, then the earlier kind in KINDS.
# Placeholders never match a detector, so scrubbing twice changes nothing.
