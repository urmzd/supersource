# contracts/py/tinyllm/train/precision.pyi (L11.1): emulated mixed precision,
# dynamic loss scaling, and gradient accumulation
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p11-training-at-scale/01-mixed-precision-accumulation-and-checkpointing.md
#
# numpy has no bfloat16, so low precision is emulated: a value "stored in
# bf16" is a float array whose every entry is a bf16 value, made by M09.1's
# round_to_bf16 (round_to_fp16 for fp16). The parameters stay full-precision
# master weights; only the matmuls run on rounded operands, as under
# torch.autocast. `dtype` is "bf16" or "fp16" throughout.
#
# Words used below:
#   cast        the differentiable rounding op below: forward rounds the
#               data to dtype, backward rounds the incoming gradient to dtype
#               (the gradient of a cast is the cast of the gradient)
#   micro-batch one of the pieces a batch is split into; its size is the
#               length of the first array of its dict (as L0.5's evaluate)
