# contracts/py/tinyllm/train/loop.pyi (L0.5): data loader, train step, eval loop
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p00-foundations/05-training-loop-and-the-autograd-bigram.md
#
# The three pieces every training run in the course is made of:
#
#   loader = DataLoader({"x": X, "y": Y}, batch_size=32, shuffle=True, rng=rng)
#   for epoch in range(E):
#       for batch in loader:
#           stats = train_step(model, batch, loss_fn, opt, clip=1.0)
#   metrics = evaluate(model, val_loader, loss_fn)
#
# loss_fn(model, batch) returns a one-element loss Tensor (L0.1), or a pair
# (loss, {name: float}) of the loss and extra metrics (an accuracy). `opt` is
# an optimizer of the M10.2 protocol: zero_grad(), step(), over the model's
# parameters. `rng` is a PCG32 (M06.3), whose shuffle(xs) is spec/pcg32.md's
# Fisher-Yates.
