# contracts/py/tinyllm/eval/seqmetrics.pyi (L4.5): exact match, BLEU, chrF, and their bootstrap intervals
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p04-attention-origins/05-sequence-metrics.md
#
# Metrics that grade generated sequences against references. The numbers
# match sacreBLEU 2.x with its defaults (Post 2018), so a score you report is
# comparable with every paper that reports sacreBLEU:
#
#   BLEU (Papineni et al. 2002), corpus level, 13a tokenization, no
#   lowercasing, n-gram orders 1..4, "exp" smoothing, brevity penalty from
#   the closest reference length. Reported on a 0..100 scale.
#   chrF (Popovic 2015), character n-grams of orders 1..n with white space
#   removed, beta = 2, corpus statistics pooled over sentences, precision and
#   recall averaged over the orders where both sides have n-grams, then the
#   F-beta of the two averages. Reported on a 0..100 scale.
#   exact match: the fraction (0..1) of hypotheses equal to their reference
#   after str.strip() on both; case and inner white space count.
#
# References are PER HYPOTHESIS: refs[i] is the list of references of
# hyps[i] (one or more; sacreBLEU's own API takes reference STREAMS, the
# transpose). A bare string in refs[i] is a TypeError, never a sequence of
# characters.
#
# Sufficient statistics (sacreBLEU's order) make corpus scores additive, so
# a corpus score is computed from the SUM of per-sentence statistics, never
# the mean of sentence scores:
#   BLEU: [hyp_len, ref_len, correct_1..correct_4, total_1..total_4]
#         ref_len is the length of the reference closest to hyp_len (ties to
#         the shorter); correct_n counts hypothesis n-grams clipped by the
#         largest count of that n-gram in any one reference.
#   chrF: per order k = 1..n the triple [hyp_count, ref_count, match]; with
#         several references the triple list of the reference with the best
#         sentence chrF (ties to the first); hyp_count is 0 for an order the
#         reference has no n-gram of (sacreBLEU's rule).
#
# Intervals: metric_ci resamples SENTENCES (hypothesis and its references
# together) with M07.4's bootstrap_ci and recomputes the corpus metric from
# the resampled statistics.
