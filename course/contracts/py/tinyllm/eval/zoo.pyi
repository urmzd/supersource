# contracts/py/tinyllm/eval/zoo.pyi (L6.7): the model zoo (D36)
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p06-objectives/07-lm-evaluation-harness-and-the-model-zoo.md
#
# The manifest (zoo.json): {"suite": "zoo", "models": [entry, ...]}; paths in
# an entry are relative to the manifest's directory. Every entry has "id",
# "dir" (a model directory, or the n-gram's .safetensors file), and "task"
# (a name for the report). The rest depends on the family's kind:
#
#   kind        tl_arch                          entry fields      metric (95% CI)
#   lm          bigram ngram nplm rnnlm gpt      data: tokens .bin  bpb (M07.4 mean_ci of the per-token NLL)
#                                                (ctx_len, stride for gpt; n_bytes unless the tokenizer is
#                                                bytes: entry "tokenizer", else tl_tokenizer, else
#                                                bytes when vocab_size is 256, as for a bare n-gram file)
#   seq2seq     seq2seq transformer              data: JSONL {"src": [ids], "tgt": [ids]},

#                                                specials from config.json

#   embeddings  word2vec                         data: w1<TAB>w2<TAB>score lines
#                                                                   spearman (Fisher z)

# Text rows are encoded with the byte tokenizer: [cls] + UTF-8 bytes + [sep],
# cut to the model's max length, right-padded with pad_id (D32: the control
# bytes 0 to 4 are free for specials). Sequence-to-sequence EM compares the
# best hypothesis without its eos with "tgt" through L4.5's exact_match on
# space-joined ids; beam search is L4.4's (seq2seq) or L5.5's translate.
#
# The report (formats/eval-results.schema.json): {"format":
# "tl.eval-results.v1", "suite", "seed", "manifest", "rows"}, one row per
# entry in manifest order. A row that cannot be scored has status "error" (an
# exception, its type and message in "reason") or "skipped" (no scorer for
# its tl_arch) and value null; the other rows are still scored. The random
# draws (bert's masking, electra's corruption) come from rng in row order.
# tl_arch is left out of a row when the schema's enum lacks it (the n-gram).
#
# A word2vec directory (save_word2vec): config.json {"tl_arch": "word2vec",
