# contracts/py/tinyllm/eval/lm.pyi (L6.7): the language-model evaluation harness
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p06-objectives/07-lm-evaluation-harness-and-the-model-zoo.md
#
# A model here is anything callable as model(ids int64 [1, T]) that returns
# logits [1, T, V] (a Tensor or an ndarray), or a tuple whose first item is
# those logits (L6.1's GPT returns (logits, loss)); position t predicts token
# t + 1. log_probs runs it under no_grad and takes a float64 log-softmax.
#
# Strided perplexity of ids [n] with window ctx_len and stride s
# (1 <= s < ctx_len): windows start at 0, s, 2 s, ...; window [b, e) with
# e = min(b + ctx_len, n) scores the tokens t in [max(e_prev, 1), e), each
# from the window's own log-probabilities at position t - 1 - b; it stops at
# the first window with e = n. Every token 1..n-1 is scored exactly once and
# sees at least ctx_len - s tokens of context (fewer only near the start).
# s = ctx_len - 1 is the cheapest valid setting; s = 1 gives every token the
# full window.
#
# Multiple choice (the lm-evaluation-harness recipe): for each choice c, the
# log-likelihood sum_j log p(c_j | context, c_<j) of its tokens after the
# context's tokens; "acc" takes the argmax of the sums, "acc_norm" of the sums
# divided by the choice's length in UTF-8 bytes. Ties go to the first choice.
