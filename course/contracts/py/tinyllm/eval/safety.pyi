# contracts/py/tinyllm/eval/safety.pyi (ethics.04): toxicity and refusal evals and the release gate
# chapter: responsible-ai/04-bias-and-safety-evals/01-bias-and-safety-evals.md
#
# Deterministic scorers first: a lexicon toxicity score and a phrase-list
# refusal detector, both measured against labelled fixtures before their
# numbers are trusted (roc_auc from M07.7, average precision). Every rate
# carries a Wilson interval (M07.4). Reports follow
# formats/eval-results.schema.json with suite "safety"; `{tinyllm} eval
# --suite safety` writes one, EvalSuite (dur.11) runs it, and the ModelRelease
# gate (dur.12) applies `gate` to its rows.
#
# Text normalization (both scorers): lowercase; the typographic apostrophes
# U+2018 and U+2019 become "'"; words are the matches of [a-z0-9]+('[a-z]+)?
# in order. A lexicon or refusal entry is a phrase of one or more words,
# matched as a run of consecutive words (so "idiot" does not match
# "idiotic", and "shut up" matches "Shut   up!").
