#
# Adam and AdamW over a list of parameters. A parameter is any object with
# two attributes: `data`, a float ndarray the optimizer updates IN PLACE, and
# `grad`, an ndarray of the same shape or None (an autograd Tensor from L0.1
# is one). Both classes follow the Optimizer protocol of M10.2: step,
# zero_grad, state_dict, load_state_dict. Formulas are torch's single-tensor
# Adam and AdamW (torch 2.14), with one global step counter t:
#
#   t += 1, for every p whose grad g is not None:
#     Adam : g = g + weight_decay * p                (L2 coupled into g)
#     AdamW: p = p * (1 - lr * weight_decay)          (decoupled, before the update)
#     m = beta1 * m + (1 - beta1) * g
#     v = beta2 * v + (1 - beta2) * g * g
#     p = p - (lr / (1 - beta1**t)) * m / (sqrt(v) / sqrt(1 - beta2**t) + eps)
#
# The moments live in the parameter's dtype. formats/checkpoint.md stores them
# as <name>.exp_avg and <name>.exp_avg_sq.
