#
# Speculative decoding: a cheap draft proposes k tokens, the target model
# scores all of them in ONE forward pass, and a verification rule keeps the
# longest acceptable prefix plus one token of the target's own. With greedy
# decoding the rule is "keep while the draft equals the target's argmax", so
# the output is token for token the target's greedy output. With sampling the
# rule is M07.6's rejection step (accept x ~ q with probability
# min(1, p(x) / q(x)), else draw from the residual), so every emitted token
# is distributed exactly as the target's sampler (L8.1) would draw it.
#
# Randomness: one request generator (L8.1's request_rng(seed), seed 0 when
# p.seed is None) serves the draft and the verifier, in program order. For
# each verified draft position the verifier draws exactly two uniforms,
# u_accept then u_resample (both always, so the count does not depend on the
# outcome); the bonus token after a fully accepted draft is L8.1's sample
# (one uniform). Greedy (temperature 0) draws nothing. The Rust port (L10.8)
# follows the same order and is held to the same outputs on shared logits.
