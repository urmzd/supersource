#
# Contiguous KV caches for incremental decoding. Keys and values of every
# position already processed are kept per layer, so a decode step computes
# attention for ONE new query against all cached keys instead of re-running
# the whole prefix. KVCache implements L7.5's KVCacheHook (update(layer,
# k_new, v_new)); LatentCache implements L7.6's LatentCacheHook (MLA caches a
# compressed latent and a small RoPE key per position, not per-head K and V).
#
# Storage is preallocated: [batch, n_kv_heads, max_len, d_head] per layer for
# K and for V, in `dtype` (float32, or float16 to halve the bytes; L8.3
# compares its paged cache against this one with float16). Each layer has its
# own fill count; `seq_len()` is the COMMITTED length, the minimum over
# layers, so it moves only after the last layer of a forward pass has
# appended (`seq_len(layer)` is one layer's count, L7.5's convention). A
# model reads `positions(T)` and `mask(T)` once at the start of a forward
# pass, before any update.
