# contracts/py/tinyllm/infer/sample.pyi (L8.1)
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p08-inference/01-sampling-and-logit-processors.md
#
# The sampler of spec/sampling.md, step for step, in IEEE float64: widen,
# repetition penalty (HF), presence and frequency penalties (OpenAI),
# greedy when temperature == 0, temperature, top-k, top-p, min-p, softmax,
# exactly one uniform per sampled token, inverse CDF. Given the same logits
# and the same generator, the Rust engine (L10.1) returns the same id and
# the same logprob, so every rule below is part of that parity contract:
#
#   * every sum runs over ids in ascending order with a plain left-to-right
#     loop (not Python's sum(), which compensates since 3.12, and not
#     numpy's pairwise np.sum);
#   * exp and log are the platform's float64 functions (math.exp, math.log);
#   * orderings are by (logit descending, id ascending), so ties go to the
#     lowest id;
#   * a logit of -inf (a mask from L8.7) is a token that cannot be sampled;
#     it never enters the kept set, so the inverse-CDF fallback of step 11
#     (rounding left the running sum below u) is the largest kept id, which
#     always has q > 0.
#
# `prompt` holds the request's prompt ids and `history` the ids generated so
# far (`out` in the spec): the repetition penalty looks at both, presence and
# frequency at `history` only. The generator is `rng` with a uniform()
# method (PCG32 of spec/pcg32.md); request_rng(seed) builds a request's.
