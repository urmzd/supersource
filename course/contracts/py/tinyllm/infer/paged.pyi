# contracts/py/tinyllm/infer/paged.pyi (L8.3): a pure-Python paged KV cache
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p08-inference/03-paged-kv-cache.md
#
# The cache stores K and V in fixed-size NumPy blocks. A sequence is a block
# table, the list of block ids holding its positions in order: position p is
# in slot p % B of
# block table[p // B], B = block_size. Inside a block, the K (or V) slab of a
# layer is [n_kv_heads][block_size][d_head] float16; gather copies them into
# contiguous arrays.
#
# Words used below:
#   seq_id     any int naming a live sequence
#   len(l)     how many positions of layer l a sequence holds; every layer
#              is appended separately, so the lengths may differ mid-step
#   shared     a block that more than one sequence's table holds (after fork)
#
# Values are stored as float16 (round to nearest even), so gather returns
# exactly what a contiguous float16 cache (L8.2, dtype=np.float16) holds.
# Writes never touch a shared block: append copies it first, so
# a fork's parent and child diverge without seeing each other's tokens.
