# contracts/py/tinyllm/infer/quant.pyi (L8.5): weight and KV quantization
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p08-inference/05-quantization.md
#
# Every scheme is symmetric (no zero point) and stores small integers or
# low-precision codes plus scales; dequantizing multiplies them back. Rounding
# to an integer is round half to even (np.rint) everywhere.
#
#   int8 per channel   W[r, c] ~ q[r, c] * s[r],  s[r] = amax(row r) / 127 (float32),
#                      q = rint(W / s) in [-127, 127]; a zero row has s = 0, q = 0
#   int4 group         W[r, c] ~ q[r, c] * s[r, c // group], q in [-8, 7],
#                      s = float16(amax(group) / 7), and q = rint(W / s) computed
#                      with the float16 scale ACTUALLY stored, so |W - q*s| <= s/2;
#                      (weights are float32 and every quotient W / s is formed in
#                      float32 before rounding, here and for int8)
#                      a group whose scale is 0 (all zero, or underflow) has q = 0.
#                      Packed per formats/safetensors.md: byte b of row r holds
#                      column 2b in its low nibble and 2b + 1 in its high nibble,
#                      each in 4-bit two's complement (the L9.5 kernel layout)
#   fp8 per channel    codes of W[r] / s[r] in OCP E4M3 (or E5M2) through M09.4's
#                      tinyllm.num.lowp, s[r] = float32(amax(row r)) / float32(fp8 max),
#                      1.0 for a zero row
#   mxfp4              M09.4's mx_quantize: blocks of 32 along a row share one
#                      E8M0 power-of-two scale, elements are FP4 E2M1 codes
#   KV fp8             formats/kv-block.md format v2: one float32 scale per head
#                      of a [n_kv_heads, T, d_head] slab, s = float32(amax) /
#                      float32(448) (1.0 when amax is 0), codes E4M3 of x / s
