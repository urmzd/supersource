# Autoregressive generation: encode the prompt, run the model once over it
# (prefill), then repeatedly sample one token (L8.1) and run the model on
# that token alone against the KV cache (decode), streaming text through an
# incremental UTF-8 detokenizer and stopping at EOS, a stop string, or the
# token budget.
