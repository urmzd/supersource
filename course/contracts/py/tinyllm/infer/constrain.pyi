# Constrained decoding: the model may only emit tokens that keep the output a
# prefix of some string in a regular language. A regex (or a JSON schema,
# translated to a regex) becomes a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) over
# BYTES; every token is a byte string; a token is allowed in DFA state s
# exactly when walking its bytes from s never leaves the live states (states
# from which an accepting state is still reachable). The sampler (L8.1) then
# draws from the logits with every disallowed token set to -inf.
#
# Regex subset (a whole-string match, like re.fullmatch on bytes): literal
# characters (ASCII); escapes \\ \. \* \+ \? \( \) \[ \] \{ \} \| \^ \$ \/ \"
# \- \, \: and \n \t \r \f \v \xHH; classes \d \w \s (as in Python's bytes
# regexes: [0-9], [A-Za-z0-9_], [ \t\n\r\f\v]) and their negations \D \W \S;
# `.` (any byte except \n); bracket classes [a-z_] and [^...] (complement
# over the 256 byte values) with ranges and the escapes above; groups (...)
# and (?:...); alternation |; quantifiers * + ? {m} {m,} {m,n} (m <= n <=
# 256). Non-ASCII characters in a pattern are a ValueError (write \xHH), as
# are anchors, backreferences, lookarounds, lazy quantifiers, and any other
# syntax.
#
# The DFA is canonical: dead states removed, minimized (Moore), and numbered
# in breadth-first order from the start state (0) taking bytes 0..255 in
# ascending order. Two patterns with the same language have the same DFA, so
# the Rust port (L10.9) can compare transition tables and masks directly.
