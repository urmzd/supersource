# contracts/py/tinyllm/seq2seq/additive.pyi (L4.2): Bahdanau additive attention
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p04-attention-origins/02-bahdanau-additive-attention.md
#
# Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio (2015). A decoder state (the query q) reads the
# encoder outputs (the keys k_1 .. k_S) through a weighted average whose
# weights it computes itself, one score per source position:
#
#     e_s     = v . tanh(W q + U k_s + b)                 score, a scalar
#     e_s     = -inf where mask[s] is False               padding is never read
#     a       = softmax(e)                                 weights over s, sum 1
#     context = sum_s a_s k_s                              [Dk]
#
# Shapes, batch first:
#   query  [B, Dq]     the decoder state that asks
#   keys   [B, S, Dk]  the encoder outputs that answer (also the values)
#   mask   bool [B, S], True where a position may be read (length_mask)
#   proj   [B, S, A]   U k_s + b for every s: project_keys(keys), computed once
#                      per source sentence and reused at every decoder step
#
# Parameters, in registration order (= state_dict order = safetensors keys),
# float32, from L0.4's Linear, drawn from one rng (PCG32, M06.3; None means
# PCG32(0).substream("init")) in this order:
#   query.weight  W  [A, Dq]   Linear(Dq, A, bias=False)
#   key.weight    U  [A, Dk]   Linear(Dk, A)
#   key.bias      b  [A]
#   v.weight      v  [1, A]    Linear(A, 1, bias=False)
#
# Every forward is built from the op library (L0.2), so backward reaches the
# query, the keys, and every parameter. A row whose mask is all False (an
# empty source) gets weights 0 and context 0, not NaN (M09.2's softmax of an
# all -inf row), and passes no gradient.
