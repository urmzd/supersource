# contracts/py/tinyllm/seq2seq/luong.pyi (L4.3): Luong attention and input feeding
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p04-attention-origins/03-luong-attention-input-feeding.md
#
# Luong, Pham, and Manning (2015). Same reading as Bahdanau's (L4.2): scores,
# a masked softmax, a weighted average of the keys. Two differences: the
# query is the decoder state AFTER this step's recurrence (h_t, not h_{t-1}),
# and the score is one of three simpler functions, all of query dimension d
# and key dimension d:
#
#     dot      e_s = h . k_s
#     general  e_s = h . (W_a k_s)                       W_a: Linear(d, d, bias=False)
#     concat   e_s = v . tanh(W_a [h ; k_s])            W_a: Linear(2d, d, bias=False),
#                                                          v: Linear(d, 1, bias=False)
#
# then  a = softmax(e masked to -inf where mask is False),  c = sum_s a_s k_s,
# and the attentional state that the output layer reads:
#
#     h~ = tanh(W_c [c ; h])                             W_c: Linear(2d, d, bias=False)
#
# Input feeding: the decoder's next input is [embedding(y_t) ; h~_t], so the
# next step knows where the model just looked (h~_0 = 0). The seq2seq decoder
# (L4.1) does that concatenation; this module provides h~.
#
# Parameters, in registration order (= state_dict order), float32, from L0.4's
# Linear, drawn from one rng (PCG32; None means PCG32(0).substream("init")):
#   dot:      combine.weight [d, 2d]
#   general:  score_proj.weight [d, d], combine.weight [d, 2d]
#   concat:   score_proj.weight [d, 2d], v.weight [1, d], combine.weight [d, 2d]
# For concat, score_proj.weight[:, :d] multiplies h and [:, d:] multiplies k_s.
#
# Shapes as L4.2: query [B, d], keys [B, S, d], mask bool [B, S] (True =
# may be read, L4.2's length_mask), proj [B, S, d] from project_keys.
# All forwards are built from the op library (L0.2).
