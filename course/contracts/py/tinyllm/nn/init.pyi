# Weight initializers that keep activation variance constant through depth.
# A weight of shape (out, in, *kernel) has fan_in = in * prod(kernel) and
# fan_out = out * prod(kernel) (torch's rule; a Linear weight is (out, in)).
# Every initializer returns a new float32 array of the given shape, filled in
# C (row-major) order, one draw per element, from `rng` (a PCG32 of M06.3,
# spec/pcg32.md): uniforms are rng.uniform(); normals are
# tinyllm.prob.rv.normal(rng, n) (M07.0), so a seed fixes the weights in
# every language.
