# A binary classifier and the three numbers that judge it: logistic
# regression fitted by Newton's method (iteratively reweighted least squares,
# IRLS, each step one linear solve with M03.2's LU), the area under the ROC
# curve (M01.4's trapezoid over the curve's corners), and the expected
# calibration error, with the one-parameter fix for a miscalibrated model:
# temperature scaling, fitted by M01.2's scalar newton. L6.5 fits the usage-policy head (D33,
# formats/linear-head.schema.json) with logistic_regression_fit and reports
# roc_auc and ece; ethics.04 puts them in the safety report.
#
# Labels are 0 or 1 (bool or integer arrays); all arithmetic is float64.
