# Three exact ways to draw from a categorical distribution p over the ids
# 0..n-1, plus the inverse CDF of the exponential distribution for Poisson
# arrivals. Every function is deterministic given its uniforms: randomness
# comes in as u in [0, 1) or as an `rng` with a `uniform() -> float` method
# (the PCG32 of spec/pcg32.md: M06.3 in your repo, the frozen copy in course
# tests). Arithmetic is IEEE float64.
