# Estimating a categorical distribution from counts. counts maps an outcome
# (a word, an n-gram, a subword) to how often it was seen. A count is a
# finite non-negative real number: an int from counting, or a fraction from
# the expected counts of EM (L1.4); bool is not a count. A key with count 0
# is an outcome known to be in the vocabulary but not seen. N = sum of the
# counts. Probabilities are float64; every function returns a new dict.
