# Hypothesis tests for "is model B really better than model A?": a p-value is
# the probability, if the null hypothesis H0 is true, of a statistic at least
# as extreme as the one observed. Small p-values are evidence against H0.
#
# Permutation tests build the null distribution by relabelling the data the
# way H0 says is harmless. Every one is two-sided (it compares |statistic|),
# counts a permuted statistic as "at least as extreme" when it is >= the
# observed one up to a relative 1e-9 (so rounding never splits a tie), and
# returns the add-one estimate p = (1 + count) / (1 + n_perm), which is never
# 0 and never below 1 / (1 + n_perm). Randomness comes in through an `rng`
# with a `uniform() -> float` method (the PCG32 of spec/pcg32.md: M06.3 in
# your repo, the frozen copy in course tests), consumed in the documented
# order so load.02's Go port gets bit-identical p-values from the same seed.
# All arithmetic is float64.
