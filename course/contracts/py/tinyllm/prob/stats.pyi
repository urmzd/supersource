#
# Confidence intervals: the error bars every metric in the course carries
# (L4.5 sequence metrics, L6.7 evaluation, L8.5 quantization verdicts, L10.7).
# The law of large numbers says a sample mean converges to the true mean; the
# central limit theorem says how fast, with a normal shape and standard
# deviation sigma / sqrt(n). An interval is "estimate +- quantile * standard
# error", or, when no formula exists, the spread of the statistic over
# bootstrap resamples.
#
# All arithmetic is float64. Quantiles of the normal and Student t
# distributions are computed here from first principles (erfc and the
# closed-form t series, then bisection), so no statistics library is needed.
# Randomness comes in through an `rng` with a `uniform() -> float` method (the
# PCG32 of spec/pcg32.md: M06.3 in your repo, the frozen copy in course tests).
