# Rejection sampling over a finite set of ids 0..n-1, and the one-step
# correction that makes speculative decoding (L8.6, L10.8) exact: a draft
# token x drawn from a proposal q is kept with probability min(1, p_x / q_x),
# and on rejection a replacement is drawn from the residual distribution
# normalize(max(0, p - q)). The token that comes out is distributed exactly
# as p.
#
# Randomness arrives from outside, as uniforms u in [0, 1) or an `rng` with a
# `uniform() -> float` method (PCG32, spec/pcg32.md), so every function is a
# deterministic map from uniforms to outcomes. All arithmetic is IEEE
# float64, and every sum runs over ids in ascending order with a plain
# left-to-right loop, so the Rust port (L10.8) reproduces it bit for bit.
# Distributions are checked like M07.1's sample_categorical: 1-D, non-empty,
# finite, non-negative, summing to 1 within 1e-9 * n + 1e-12 (ValueError
# otherwise).
