# contracts/py/tinyllm/lm/word2vec.pyi (L2.3): word2vec skip-gram with negative sampling, and PPMI-SVD
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p02-statistical-lm/03-word2vec-and-ppmi-svd.md
#
# Two ways to turn co-occurrence into word vectors. Skip-gram with negative
# sampling (SGNS, Mikolov et al. 2013) trains two tables by manual sparse SGD
# (no autograd): W_in (one vector v_w per center word, the embeddings) and
# W_out (one vector u_c per context word). For a (center c, context o) pair
# and K negatives k_1..k_K drawn from the noise distribution P_n:
#
#     loss = -log sigma(u_o . v_c) - sum_j log sigma(-u_{k_j} . v_c)
#
# PPMI-SVD (Levy and Goldberg 2014) factorizes the positive PMI matrix of the
# same co-occurrences directly (M11.4's ppmi, M03.5's svd).
#
# Words are ids 0..V-1. All arrays are float64 unless noted. Every random
# choice comes from ONE generator `rng` (a PCG32, M06.3; None means
# PCG32(0).substream("init")) given to SkipGramNS, in call order:
#   __init__   V * dim uniforms (W_in, C order)
#   pairs      one uniform per input token, then one below(window) per kept token
#   negatives  one uniform per draw (M07.1's AliasTable.sample)
#   step       negatives(B * n_neg)
# so a seed fixes the whole run.
