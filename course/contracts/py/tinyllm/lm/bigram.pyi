#
# A bigram language model is a [V, V] table `weight`: row i holds the
# next-token logits after token i, and softmax(weight[i]) is the model's
# distribution over the next token. V is the vocabulary size (256 for the
# byte tokenizer, formats/tokenizer.md). Ids are integers in [0, V).
#
# L0.5 keeps every BigramLM signature of v0. What changes: `sample` draws from
# PCG32 (spec/pcg32.md, tinyllm.num.rng, M06.3) exactly as the tracer engine
# does (L10.0), so a seed gives the same ids in Python and in Rust; and
# BigramLogits trains the same table with the course's autograd (L0.1 to L0.4).
