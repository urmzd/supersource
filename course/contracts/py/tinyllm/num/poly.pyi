# A polynomial p(x) = c[0] + c[1] x + ... + c[n] x^n is its list of
# coefficients in ASCENDING order of power (coeffs[k] multiplies x^k).
# numpy.polyval uses the opposite order.

    float64 scalar). Empty coeffs is the zero polynomial (zeros). Exact when
    the coefficients and x are integers and every partial result stays below
