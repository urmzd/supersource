#
# Low-precision formats, emulated exactly in numpy:
#
#   e4m3      OCP FP8 E4M3 (E4M3FN): 1 sign, 4 exponent (bias 7), 3 fraction
#             bits; no infinity; 0x7F and 0xFF are NaN; max finite 448.
#   e5m2      OCP FP8 E5M2: 1, 5 (bias 15), 2; IEEE-like: 0x7C is +inf,
#             0x7D to 0x7F NaN; max finite 57344.
#   fp4_e2m1  OCP FP4 E2M1 (an MX element type): 1, 2 (bias 1), 1; values
#             0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6; no infinity or NaN. Codes 0..15.
#   e8m0      OCP E8M0, the MX block scale: an unsigned exponent, value
#             2^(code - 127) for codes 0..254; 255 is NaN; no zero.
#
# Rounding is to nearest with ties to even, once, from the exact input
# value. Encoding a float32 follows the same edge rules as the C
# conversions in tinyllm/numerics.h:
#   e4m3  |x| > 448 and +-inf saturate to +-448 (0x7E, 0xFE); NaN gives 0x7F;
#         |x| <= 2^-10 gives +-0 with the sign kept.
#   e5m2  a finite x that rounds above 57344 saturates to +-57344 (0x7B,
#         0xFB); +-inf stays +-inf (0x7C, 0xFC); NaN gives 0x7F.
#   fp4   |x| above 6 saturates to +-6 (0x7, 0xF).
# Decoding is exact for every code.
#
# MX (OCP Microscaling Formats v1.0): a block of `block` consecutive values
# along the last axis shares one e8m0 scale X = 2^(floor(log2(amax)) - emax)
# with amax the block's largest magnitude and emax the exponent of the
# element format's largest normal (fp4_e2m1: 2, as 6 = 1.5 * 2^2; e4m3: 8,
# as 448 = 1.75 * 2^8); each element is x / X rounded to the element format
# with saturation. An all-zero block takes the scale amax = 1 would give.
