# Numerical Jacobians and Jacobian-vector products of f: R^n -> R^m.
# x and f(x) may have any shape; they are flattened in row-major order, so
# n = x.size, m = f(x).size, and J[i, j] = d f(x).flat[i] / d x.flat[j].
# All arithmetic is float64 on a private copy of x; the caller's x is never
# modified. The forward-mode product J v and the reverse-mode product u^T J
# are what autodiff computes without forming J (M08.1, M08.2).
