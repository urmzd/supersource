# The exponential moving average m_t = beta m_{t-1} + (1 - beta) x_t, m_0 = 0,
# is the weighted sum sum_{i=1}^{t} (1 - beta) beta**(t - i) x_i: a truncated
# geometric series whose weights add up to 1 - beta**t, not 1. Dividing by
# that sum removes the bias toward m_0 = 0 (Adam's bias correction, M10.3).
# The weights and their total come from tinyllm.num.series (M00.3).
