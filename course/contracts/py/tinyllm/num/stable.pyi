# Every function takes a numpy array (anything np.asarray accepts). Float
# inputs keep their dtype (float32 in, float32 out); integer inputs are
# computed in float64. `axis` follows numpy (negative counts from the end).
#
# Masked entries are -inf. A row whose entries are all -inf (a fully masked
# row) is defined, never NaN: logsumexp = -inf, softmax = zeros,
# log_softmax = -inf. NaN in a row propagates to that row.
