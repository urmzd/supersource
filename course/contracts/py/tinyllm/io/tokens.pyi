# contracts/py/tinyllm/io/tokens.pyi (L0.6): the token-stream reader
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p00-foundations/06-safetensors-checkpoints-and-token-streams.md
#
# Shards are formats/tokens-bin.md files (llm.c .bin): a 1024-byte header of
# 256 little-endian int32 [magic 20240520, version, n_tokens, vocab_size],
# then n_tokens ids, uint16 (version 1) or uint32 (version 2). data.07 writes
# them; this module reads them through np.memmap, without loading a shard.
#
# The stream. T = seq_len. A window is T + 1 consecutive ids at some offset:
# inputs are its first T, targets its last T. The stream reads shard 0, then
# 1, ..., then wraps to 0. Each pass over a shard (including the first, at
# construction) starts at offset rng.below(min(T, n - T)) of that shard, and
# successive windows start T apart (each window's last id is the next one's
# first), until a window would run past the end of the shard; then the next
# pass begins. One batch is B windows in this order. rng is a PCG32 (M06.3):
# below(n), state(), set_state(s); the stream advances it only at the start
# of a pass.
#
# The cursor is the whole position: {"shard": i, "offset": the offset of the
# next window in shard i (it may be past the last full window: the pass
# ends at the next draw), "rng": rng.state()}. Restoring a cursor into a
# stream over the same shards continues bit for bit: N batches, cursor,
# restore in a new stream, M batches equals N + M batches of one stream.
