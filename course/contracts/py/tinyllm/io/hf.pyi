# contracts/py/tinyllm/io/hf.pyi (L7.9): download files from the Hugging Face Hub
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p07-modern-block/09-llama-family-model.md
#
# The Hub serves every file of a repository at
#
#     {endpoint}/{repo_id}/resolve/{revision}/{filename}
#
# endpoint is the argument, else the HF_ENDPOINT environment variable, else
# https://huggingface.co. Large (LFS) files answer with a redirect to a CDN;
# the first response carries X-Linked-Etag, the file's sha256 in quotes, and
# X-Linked-Size. A request may carry "Range: bytes=<start>-" to resume: the
# server answers 206 with the rest, or 200 with the whole file when it
# ignores ranges. HF_TOKEN, when set, is sent as "Authorization: Bearer".
#
# Files land in <cache_dir>/<repo_id with "/" as "--">/<revision>/<filename>.
# A download writes <filename>.part first and renames it into place only after
# its size and sha256 check out, so a crash or a bad byte never leaves a
# truncated or corrupt file under the final name.
