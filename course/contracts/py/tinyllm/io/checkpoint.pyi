# contracts/py/tinyllm/io/checkpoint.pyi (L0.6): atomic checkpoints
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p00-foundations/06-safetensors-checkpoints-and-token-streams.md
#
# The on-disk layout is formats/checkpoint.md: <dir>/step-<nnnnnn>/ holding
# model.safetensors, optimizer.safetensors, trainer_state.json
# (trainer-state.schema.json), config.json when there is one, and
# MANIFEST.json (manifest.schema.json, kind "checkpoint") written last; and
# <dir>/LATEST, the name of the newest complete step directory and "\n".
#
# Words used below:
#   complete   MANIFEST.json exists, lists model.safetensors,
#              optimizer.safetensors, and trainer_state.json, lists every
#              other file in the directory, and every listed file has its
#              size and sha256
#   rng_state  the shuffle PCG32's (state, inc) (M06.3 PCG32.state()), stored
#              as 16 hex digits each so no JSON reader rounds them
#
# Optimizer state goes into optimizer.safetensors as F32 tensors named
# "<parameter name>.<state key>" (AdamW "fc.weight.exp_avg", SGD
# "fc.weight.momentum_buffer"), with the rest of opt.state_dict() (step
# count, hyperparameters) as JSON in the metadata key "state".
