# contracts/py/tinyllm/io/activity.pyi (dur.09): the Python half of a subprocess activity
# chapter: ai-platform-engineering/05-durable-orchestration-and-workers/09-subprocess-activities.md
#
# The whole interface between the Go worker and a Python entry is
# spec/subprocess-activity.md. This module is the helper every Python
# activity entry ({tinyllm} train, eval, export; {corpus} run --stage) runs
# under, so each of them gets the same progress file, signal handling,
# atomic outputs, and exit codes:
#
#     def train_main(act: Activity) -> list[str]:
#         spec = act.load_spec(validate)            # SpecError: exit 65
#         start = resume_from(act.resume)           # None on attempt 1
#         for step in range(start, spec["steps"]):
#             ...
#             act.step(step, loss, lr, tokens)
#             if step % 500 == 0 or act.cancelled:
#                 path = save_checkpoint(...)       # L0.6
#                 act.checkpoint(step, path)        # only after it is complete
#             act.check_cancel()                    # Cancelled: exit 130
#         return [final_dir]                        # outputs, relative to TL_ARTIFACTS
#
#     sys.exit(run(train_main, sys.argv[1:]))
#
# Words used below:
#   work dir   the directory holding --progress: the runner makes it
#              <TL_ARTIFACTS>/activities/<TL_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY>/, the same for
#              every attempt of one activity
#   artifact path
#              a path relative to TL_ARTIFACTS (absolute paths under it are
#              accepted and made relative); a path outside it is ValueError
#   publish    write <name>.tmp, flush and fsync it, rename it to <name>, and
#              fsync the directory: a reader sees the old file or the whole
#              new one, never a prefix
