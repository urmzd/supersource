# Course dtypes and the numpy arrays that carry them:
#
#   F32      float32            F16    float16
#   BF16     float32 values     I8     int8
#            (or uint16 bits)   U8     uint8
#   F8_E4M3  float32 values     I32    int32
#            (or uint8 codes)
#
# numpy has no bfloat16 or float8 type. The writer rounds float32 values to
# BF16 and F8_E4M3 to nearest, ties to even (BF16 through
# tinyllm.num.fp.f32_to_bf16_bits, M09.1); the reader decodes both back to
# float32, which holds every BF16 and F8_E4M3 value exactly. F8_E4M3 is the
# "fn" variant: bias 7, no infinities, S.1111.111 is NaN, largest 448.
