# contracts/py/tinyllm/info/entropy.pyi (M11.1): entropy and divergences, in nats
# chapter: math/11-information-theory/01-entropy-cross-entropy-and-kl.md
#
# Distributions are float arrays along `axis` (default the last), compared
# position by position; the result has the other axes (the reduced axis is
# dropped). Inputs are not renormalized: pass distributions that sum to 1.
# Every log is the natural log, so results are in nats (divide by ln 2 for
# bits). Conventions at zero, fixed so every caller agrees:
#
#     0 * log 0 = 0          (an outcome p never produces costs nothing)
#     p * log(p / 0) = +inf  for p > 0 (q rules out what p produces)
#
# A negative probability is a caller bug: ValueError.
