# contracts/py/tinyllm/info/pmi.pyi (M11.4): mutual information and PMI, in nats
# chapter: math/11-information-theory/04-mutual-information-pmi-ppmi.md
#
# A co-occurrence table cooc[w, c] counts how often word w was seen with
# context c (any non-negative numbers: counts, or weighted counts). With
# D = sum of all entries, #(w) = row sums, #(c) = column sums, the maximum
# likelihood probabilities are P(w, c) = cooc[w, c] / D, P(w) = #(w) / D,
# P(c) = #(c) / D (M07.2). Every log is natural. Inputs are not modified;
# results are float64.
