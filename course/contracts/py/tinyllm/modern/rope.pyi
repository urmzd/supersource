# contracts/py/tinyllm/modern/rope.pyi (L7.3): rotary position embeddings
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p07-modern-block/03-rope.md
#
# RoPE (Su et al. 2021) rotates pair i of a query or key vector at position
# p by the angle p * inv_freq[i] (inv_freq from M00.3's ladder, or from
# L7.4's scaled ladders). A rotation preserves length, and the dot product
# of a query rotated by angle a with a key rotated by angle b depends only on
# a - b: attention scores see relative position only.
#
#   r           rotary_dim: the first r entries of the head rotate, the other
#               dh - r pass through unchanged (partial rotary: GPT-NeoX,
#               Phi, gpt-oss uses full); r is even, r <= dh; None means dh
#   inv_freq    float [r / 2], one frequency per pair
#   cos, sin    float32 [..., r / 2]: ONE value per pair (not repeated to r)
#
# Which entries form pair i (the layout):
#   "half"         (x[i], x[i + r/2])     HF Llama / Mistral / Qwen / SmolLM2 / gpt-oss
#   "interleaved"  (x[2i], x[2i + 1])     the RoPE paper, Meta's Llama code, M00.2
# Rotating pair (a, b) by t gives (a cos t - b sin t, a sin t + b cos t).
# The two layouts hold the same rotation on a permuted vector: Meta's
# checkpoints become HF's by permuting the rows of q_proj and k_proj.
