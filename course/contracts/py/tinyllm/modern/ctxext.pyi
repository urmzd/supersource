# contracts/py/tinyllm/modern/ctxext.pyi (L7.4): context extension for RoPE, and ALiBi
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p07-modern-block/04-context-extension.md
#
# A model trained on L positions has never seen the angles p * inv_freq[i]
# for p >= L on its slow pairs. Context extension rescales inv_freq so a
# longer context L' = factor * L maps onto angles the model knows:
#
#   kind       inv_freq'[i], with theta_i = base^(-2i / r)              attention_scaling
#   default    theta_i                                                   1
#   linear     theta_i / factor              (position interpolation)    1
#   ntk        theta_i computed with base' = base * factor^(r / (r - 2)) 1
#              (NTK-aware: the fastest pair keeps its frequency, the slowest is
#              divided by exactly factor)
#   yarn       (1 - g_i) theta_i / factor + g_i theta_i, g_i = 1 - ramp_i  0.1 ln(factor) + 1
#              ramp_i = clamp((i - lo) / (hi - lo), 0, 1),                 (1 when factor <= 1)
#              lo = floor(c(beta_fast)), hi = ceil(c(beta_slow)),
#              clamped to [0, r - 1], hi = lo + 0.001 when equal,
#              c(n) = r ln(original_max_pos / (2 pi n)) / (2 ln base):
#              pairs that turn more than beta_fast times over the original
#              context keep theta_i, fewer than beta_slow times are divided by
#              factor, and the ones between blend linearly
#   llama3     wavelength w_i = 2 pi / theta_i; with L0 = original_max_pos   1
#              w_i < L0 / high_freq_factor: theta_i
#              w_i > L0 / low_freq_factor:  theta_i / factor
#              otherwise: (1 - s) theta_i / factor + s theta_i,
#              s = (L0 / w_i - low_freq_factor) / (high_freq_factor - low_freq_factor)
#
# These are Hugging Face's ROPE_INIT_FUNCTIONS (transformers 5.19.0) for
# "linear", "yarn", and "llama3"; "ntk" is the static NTK-aware rule, which
# HF's "dynamic" applies with an effective factor that grows with the
# sequence length. The attention_scaling multiplies cos and sin (L7.3), so
# YaRN's attention logits grow by attention_scaling^2.
#
# ALiBi (Press et al. 2022; optional part, DESIGN D31): no rotation at all,
# a bias added to the scores that falls linearly with distance, one slope
# per head (M00.3's alibi_slopes).
