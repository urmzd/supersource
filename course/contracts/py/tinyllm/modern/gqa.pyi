# contracts/py/tinyllm/modern/gqa.pyi (L7.5): grouped-query attention with a cache hook,
# a sliding window, and learned sinks
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p07-modern-block/05-gqa-attention.md
#
# H query heads share Hkv key/value heads (Ainslie et al. 2023): kv head j
# serves query heads j * n_rep .. (j + 1) * n_rep - 1, n_rep = H / Hkv.
# Hkv = H is multi-head attention, Hkv = 1 multi-query attention. The KV cache
# holds only the Hkv heads, so it shrinks by n_rep (M05.1 kv_bytes_per_token).
#
# Shapes: x [B, T, d]; q [B, H, T, dh]; k, v [B, Hkv, T, dh] before
# repeat_kv. Scores are q k^T / sqrt(dh).
#
# Parameters, float32; Linear layers drawn from one rng (PCG32, M06.3; None
# means PCG32(0).substream("init")) in the order q, k, v, o:
#   q_proj.weight [H dh, d]    (q_proj.bias [H dh] with qkv_bias)
#   k_proj.weight [Hkv dh, d]  (k_proj.bias with qkv_bias)
#   v_proj.weight [Hkv dh, d]  (v_proj.bias with qkv_bias)
#   o_proj.weight [d, H dh]    no bias
#   sinks         [H]          only with sinks=True; zeros at construction
# state_dict keys are HF's (LlamaAttention; Qwen2Attention with qkv_bias;
# GptOssAttention with sinks) and, like torch, list the module's own
# parameter (sinks) before its children's.
#
# forward(x, positions, mask, cache, layer):
#   1. q, k, v projections, split into heads.
#   2. RoPE (L7.3) on q and k with rope_cos_sin(positions, rope.inv_freq,
#      rope.attention_scaling), rope.layout, rope.rotary_dim. positions is
#      [T] (shared by the batch) or [B, T].
#   3. cache: when given, (k, v) = cache.update(layer, k.data, v.data): the
#      cache appends this chunk's [B, Hkv, T, dh] keys and values and returns
#      everything it holds, [B, Hkv, Tk, dh] numpy arrays, which become
#      constants (inference only: no gradient flows into the cache). Without
#      a cache, Tk = T.
#   4. Visibility: query t (0-based in this chunk) sits at key index
#      i = Tk - T + t. Key j is visible when j <= i (causal, always), and
#      i - j < window when window is set (the query and window - 1 keys
#      before it), and mask allows it. mask (optional) is boolean, True =
#      may attend, broadcastable to [B, H, T, Tk] (padding). Hidden scores
#      are -inf.
#   5. Softmax over the keys. With sinks, each head h appends one extra logit
#      sinks[h] to every row before the softmax and drops its column after:
#      the weights then sum to 1 - p_sink <= 1 (a head may attend to
#      nothing). A row with every key hidden gives weights 0 (output 0), not
#      NaN.
#   6. Weighted values (kv heads repeated by repeat_kv), heads merged, o_proj.
