# contracts/py/tinyllm/modern/norm.pyi (L7.1): RMSNorm and the Pre-LN residual step
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p07-modern-block/01-pre-ln-rmsnorm.md
#
# RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich 2019) rescales each vector to unit root mean
# square over its last axis, then multiplies by a learned gain. Unlike
# LayerNorm (L0.4) it subtracts no mean and has no bias:
#
#     rms(x) = sqrt(mean(x_i^2) + eps)        over the last axis, eps INSIDE the root
#     y      = x / rms(x) * (offset + weight)
#
# offset 0 is Llama's form (weight starts at ones); offset 1 is Gemma's form
# (weight starts at zeros, the gain is 1 + weight). The computation runs in
# x's dtype (float32 or float64), built from the op library (L0.2), so
# backward reaches x and weight.
#
# The Pre-LN residual step (Xiong et al. 2020) normalizes only the branch
# input, never the residual stream itself:
#
#     pre_norm_residual(x, norm, sublayer) = x + sublayer(norm(x))
#
# A Llama block is two of them, attention then MLP, and a final RMSNorm
# before the lm_head (L7.9).
