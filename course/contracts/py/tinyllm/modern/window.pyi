# contracts/py/tinyllm/modern/window.pyi (L7.7): sliding windows, StreamingLLM sink tokens, learned sinks
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p07-modern-block/07-sliding-window-and-sinks.md
#
# Three ways to bound what a query reads, and so what the KV cache must hold:
#
#   sliding window W   (Mistral, Beltagy et al. 2020)  query at position p reads
#                      keys p - W + 1 .. p: itself and W - 1 before it
#   sink tokens S      (StreamingLLM, Xiao et al. 2023) the first S tokens of
#                      the stream stay readable forever, on top of the window:
#                      softmax needs somewhere to put weight it does not want
#                      to give, and models learn to dump it on token 0
#   learned sinks      (gpt-oss) one extra logit per head in every softmax
#                      row, attached to no value: the head may attend to
#                      nothing (L7.5's GQAttention(sinks=True))
#
# The visibility rule, for query i of a chunk at absolute position
# p_i = q_offset + i and a key at absolute position j:
#
#     visible(i, j) = j <= p_i  and  (j < S  or  p_i - j < W)
#
# window None means no window (causal only, S is then irrelevant).
# Every boolean mask uses L5.2's convention: True = may attend.
#
# SinkWindowCache keeps the sinks and the last W - 1 positions of each layer
# (what the NEXT query needs besides itself), so a stream of any length
# holds at most S + W - 1 keys per layer between updates. Keys are cached as
# the attention layer hands them over (rotated at their absolute positions),
# so attention with this cache equals full attention under the mask above.
