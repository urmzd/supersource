# contracts/py/tinyllm/modern/moe.pyi (L7.8): mixture of experts
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p07-modern-block/08-mixture-of-experts.md
#
# A router scores E experts (L7.2 gated MLPs) for every token and sends the
# token to its top k; the output is the weighted sum of those k experts'
# outputs (plus shared experts every token uses). Parameters grow with E,
# compute per token with k.
#
# Symbols: N tokens (all leading axes flattened), d width, E n_experts,
# k top_k, f d_ff_expert, S n_shared, z = router logits x W_g^T [N, E].
#
# Routers (topk: the k largest, ties to the LOWEST expert id):
#   "softmax_topk"  p = softmax(z); idx = topk(p); w = p[idx];
#                   norm_topk: w /= sum(w)          (Mixtral, Qwen-MoE)
#   "topk_softmax"  idx = topk(z); w = softmax(z[idx]) (always sums to 1;
#                   norm_topk is ignored)          (Switch-style)
#   "sigmoid"       s = sigmoid(z); idx = topk(s + b), b the aux-free bias;
#                   w = s[idx] (the bias chooses, it never weighs);
#                   norm_topk: w /= sum(w) + 1e-20 (DeepSeek-V3)
#   then w *= routed_scaling. The router logits and the softmax/sigmoid are
#   computed in float32 at least.
#
# Load-balancing loss (Switch Transformer eq. 4 to 6 as Hugging Face's
# load_balancing_loss_func computes it, one layer, no padding mask):
#     f_e = (number of the N k assignments that went to e) / N
#     P_e = mean over tokens of router_probs[:, e]
#     L   = E * sum_e f_e P_e          (k at perfect balance, up to E k when
#                                       every token picks the same experts)
# f is a count and has no gradient; the gradient reaches the router through P.
# router_probs is softmax(z) for the softmax routers and s / sum(s) for
# "sigmoid".
#
# Aux-loss-free balancing (DeepSeek-V3): after each step,
#     b_e += bias_update_rate * sign(mean(load) - load_e)
# so an overloaded expert's bias falls and it is chosen less; b is not a
# trained parameter (it is plain state, not in state_dict).
#
# Sorted dispatch: the N k (token, slot) assignments, flattened as n k + j,
# are sorted by expert (stable), so each expert reads one contiguous slice:
#     perm      = stable argsort of topk_idx.ravel()       [N k]
#     x_sorted  = x[perm // k]                              [N k, d]
#     offsets   = [0, c_0, c_0 + c_1, ..., N k]             [E + 1], c_e = count of e
#     inv_perm  = the inverse permutation of perm           [N k]
# combine puts each output back at its assignment (y_sorted[inv_perm]) and
# sums the k slots of every token weighted by topk_w.
#
# Parameters, float32, in registration order (state_dict keys are DeepSeek's
# and Qwen-MoE's on the Hub), drawn from one rng (PCG32, M06.3; None means
# PCG32(0).substream("init")) in this order:
#   gate.weight                    [E, d]   (a Linear without bias)
#   experts.<e>.{gate,up,down}_proj.weight   GatedMLP(d, f) for e = 0 .. E - 1
#   shared_experts.{gate,up,down}_proj.weight GatedMLP(d, S f), only when S > 0
