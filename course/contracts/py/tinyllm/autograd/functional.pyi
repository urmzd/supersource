# contracts/py/tinyllm/autograd/functional.pyi (L0.2): the op library, imported as F
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p00-foundations/02-op-library-and-gradcheck.md
#
#     from tinyllm.autograd import functional as F
#
# (DESIGN 4.3 writes it `tinyllm.F`; `tinyllm` is a namespace package with no
# __init__.py, so the module is imported by its path.)
#
# Every op takes Tensors (L0.1); an ndarray or a number where a Tensor is
# expected is a constant. Every op is built on tensor.from_op: one forward in
# numpy and one vector-Jacobian product (vjp). Forward values follow numpy
# and PyTorch (the golden tests compare with torch 2.14 forward and backward);
# float32 stays float32. `axis` is an int (negative counts from the end) or,
# for the reductions, also None or a tuple. Masked entries are -inf.
#
# Gradient conventions where the function has a kink:
#   relu'(0) = 0; max sends the gradient to every maximal entry in equal
#   shares (torch.amax); a fully masked softmax row has gradient 0.
