# contracts/py/tinyllm/autograd/hvp.pyi (M08.4): Hessian-vector products and
# the recompute-versus-memory schedule of activation checkpointing
# chapter: math/08-matrix-calculus-and-autodiff/04-hessian-vector-products-and-recompute.md
#
# Curvature without the Hessian: for f: R^n -> R with gradient g(x), the
# Hessian-vector product H v is the directional derivative of g along v, so a
# central difference of two gradient calls gives it with O(eps^2) error and
# never forms the n x n matrix.
#
# Checkpoint schedules (the cost model of the chapter, section 2): a stack of
# n layers runs forward and keeps one saved input per layer for its backward,
# 1 memory unit each. A schedule is the list `starts` of segment start layers
# (starts[0] == 0, strictly increasing, every entry < n); segment i covers
# layers starts[i] .. starts[i+1] - 1 and has s_i layers. As in
# torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint_sequential, every segment but the last
# keeps only its input during the forward pass and is recomputed during
# backward; the last segment keeps all its activations. Then
#     peak       = max over i of (i + s_i)     units held at once
#     recomputed = n - s_last                  layers run forward twice
# (during the backward of segment i the inputs of segments 0 .. i-1 are still
# held, plus segment i's s_i recomputed activations).
