# contracts/py/tinyllm/autograd/dual.pyi (M08.1): forward-mode autodiff with dual numbers
# chapter: math/08-matrix-calculus-and-autodiff/01-dual-numbers-forward-mode.md
#
# A dual number a + b eps with eps^2 = 0 carries a value a and a tangent b.
# Evaluating f on x + v eps gives f(x) + (J_f(x) v) eps: the value and the
# Jacobian-vector product in one pass. `val` and `eps` are both floats, or
# both float64 arrays of one shape (a vector of dual numbers; a scalar
# tangent is broadcast to the value's shape).
#
# Arithmetic mixes Dual with Python numbers, numpy scalars, and numpy
# arrays on either side. A non-Dual operand is a constant (tangent 0).
# numpy must hand the operation to Dual even when the numpy operand is on
# the left (np.float64(2.0) * d, W @ d): Dual sets __array_ufunc__ = None.
