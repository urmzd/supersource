# For an op Y = f(X) inside a scalar loss L, the VJP maps the upstream
# gradient G = dL/dY to dL/dX. Every function here is pure: it reads its
# arguments (never writes them) and returns new float arrays of the input's
# shape. The forward pass saves what the VJP needs (y, xhat, rstd), so the
# VJP never recomputes it.
