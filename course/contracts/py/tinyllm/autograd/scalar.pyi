# Each Value is one node of a computation graph: a float `data`, the
# gradient `grad` of the final output with respect to it, the nodes it was
# computed from (`_prev`), and a closure `_backward` that pushes its own
# grad into theirs by the chain rule:
#
#     for each input x of the node y:   x.grad += dy/dx * y.grad
#
# A Python number in an operation is a constant leaf (a new Value).
