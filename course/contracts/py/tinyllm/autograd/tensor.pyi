# contracts/py/tinyllm/autograd/tensor.pyi (L0.1): the autograd Tensor
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p00-foundations/01-tensor-and-broadcasting-backward.md
#
# A Tensor is a numpy array plus the record of how it was computed. An op on
# tensors that require grad returns a new tensor holding its inputs
# (`parents`) and a vector-Jacobian product (`vjp`): given the gradient of a
# scalar loss with respect to the op's output, it returns the gradient with
# respect to each input. `backward()` walks the graph from the loss to the
# leaves in reverse topological order (tinyllm.autograd.graph.toposort, M06.1)
# and calls each vjp once.
#
# Words used below:
#   leaf      a tensor made by the constructor (not by an op); only leaves
#             with requires_grad keep a `.grad` after backward
#   constant  a tensor with requires_grad False, or any non-Tensor operand
#             (a Python number or an ndarray), converted to the other
#             operand's dtype
#   broadcast numpy broadcasting (lang.01). An input that was broadcast gets
#             its gradient summed back to its own shape
#             (tinyllm.autograd.vjp.unbroadcast, M08.3)
