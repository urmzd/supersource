# Grad mode decides whether an op records a graph node. It is on by default,
# per thread, and `no_grad` turns it off for the body of a `with` block:
# evaluation, sampling, and optimizer updates build no graph and keep no
# intermediate arrays alive.

    """True unless the current thread is inside a `no_grad()` block."""

def no_grad() -> AbstractContextManager[None]:
    """Context manager: grad mode is off inside the block and restored to its
    previous value on exit, also when the block raises. Blocks nest. Ops run
    inside it return tensors with requires_grad False and no parents."""
