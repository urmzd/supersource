# contracts/py/tinyllm/autograd/losses.pyi (L0.3): losses with a fused backward
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p00-foundations/03-losses-with-fused-backward.md
#
# Each loss is ONE graph node: the forward computes the loss from the logits
# with stable numerics (tinyllm.num.stable, M09.2), and the backward is the
# closed-form gradient (M08.3 derives it), never a chain of log, softmax, and
# gather nodes. Values and gradients match torch.nn.functional (golden tests).
# float32 logits give a float32 loss and float32 gradients.
#
# Reductions: "mean" (default), "sum", or "none" (one loss per row or element).
