#
# The Unigram LM tokenizer (Kudo 2018), sentencepiece compatible: Viterbi
# ids equal Hugging Face tokenizers' and sentencepiece's on the same vocab
# (formats/tokenizer.md, Unigram). Uses M06.2 (Trie.prefixes) for the
# lattice and M07.2 (mle) to score the seed pieces from their integer
# counts; sample_encode draws from a PCG32 (M06.3; the course tests pass
# the frozen one).
