# A finite function f: A -> B is a Mapping whose keys are its domain A and
# whose values are its outputs. Injective: no two keys share a value.
# Surjective onto B: every element of B is some value. Bijective: both, and
# then the inverse map exists. The GPT-2 byte map is a bijection from the 256
# byte values onto 256 printable, non-whitespace characters; byte-level BPE
# (L1.2) stores its vocabulary and merges as strings over that alphabet.
