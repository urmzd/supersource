#
# A trie is a rooted tree whose edges are labelled with characters. The path
# from the root to a node spells a string; a node is terminal when that
# string is a key, and then it holds the key's value. Matching walks one edge
# per character of the text, so finding every key that is a prefix of
# s[start:] costs O(length of the longest match), whatever the number of keys.
# WordPiece (L1.3) segments by repeated longest_prefix; the Unigram lattice
# (L1.4) adds one edge per match from prefixes; L1.2 matches added tokens.
