# contracts/py/tinyllm/rnn/gru.pyi (L3.3): the GRU, in torch's gate order
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p03-recurrent/03-gru.md
#
# One step, with x [B, D], state h [B, H], and the three gates stacked in
# torch's order r, z, n (rows 0:H, H:2H, 2H:3H of the weights):
#
#     a = x @ w_ih^T + b_ih                 [B, 3H]   (input part)
#     b = h @ w_hh^T + b_hh                 [B, 3H]   (recurrent part)
#     r = sigmoid(a[:, 0:H] + b[:, 0:H])         reset gate
#     z = sigmoid(a[:, H:2H] + b[:, H:2H])       update gate
#     n = tanh(a[:, 2H:3H] + r * b[:, 2H:3H])    candidate: r scales the
#                                                recurrent part AFTER its bias
#     h' = (1 - z) * n + z * h                   z = 1 keeps the old state
#
# (Cho et al. 2014 apply r to h before the matmul; torch and cuDNN apply it
# after, to h @ w_hn^T + b_hn. Weights trained one way do not load the other.)
#
# Every op is from the op library (L0.2), so autograd does the backward.
# Parameter names, shapes, and registration order are torch.nn.GRU's and
# torch.nn.GRUCell's, so torch state_dicts load by name. Parameters are
# float32.
#
# Initialization (one `rng`, a PCG32 of M06.3; None means
# PCG32(0).substream("init")), in registration order, for each layer: the
# three gate blocks of w_ih, each xavier_uniform((H, D_in), gain=1) (M07.3),
# then the three blocks of w_hh, each orthogonal_init((H, H), gain=1)
# (M03.3), stacked in the order r, z, n. Both biases are zero.
#
# Bidirectional runs are tinyllm.rnn.bi.bidirectional (L3.4) over two GRUs.
