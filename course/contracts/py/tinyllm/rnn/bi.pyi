# contracts/py/tinyllm/rnn/bi.pyi (L3.4): bidirectional RNNs with length-aware reversal
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p03-recurrent/04-bidirectional-rnn.md
#
# A batch of sequences of different lengths is padded to T steps, time first:
# x [T, B, ...], with sequence b real at t < lengths[b] and padding after.
# The backward direction must read each sequence from ITS last real step to
# its first, so reversing the whole padded tensor (x[::-1]) is wrong: it puts
# the padding first and the backward RNN reads it before the real tokens.
#
# `fwd` and `bwd` are any single-direction recurrent modules with
# forward(x, state=None, lengths=None) -> (out [T, B, H], state) that output 0
# past each length and carry their state unchanged there (L3.2 LSTM, L3.3 GRU).
# This is torch's bidirectional=True: the forward module plays the *_l0
# weights and the backward module the *_l0_reverse weights.
