# contracts/py/tinyllm/rnn/rnnlm.pyi (L3.6): an RNN language model trained with stateful TBPTT
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p03-recurrent/06-rnn-language-model-stateful-tbptt.md
#
# A recurrent language model reads token ids one at a time and predicts the
# next one from its hidden state:
#
#     e_t      = E[ids_t]                                [d_emb]
#     h_t      = cell(e_t, h_{t-1})                      [d_h] (last layer)
#     logits_t = h_t @ W_out^T + b_out                   [V]
#     loss     = mean_t cross_entropy(logits_t, ids_{t+1})
#
# cell is "lstm" (L3.2's LSTM), "gru" (L3.3's GRU), or "rnn": ElmanRNN below,
# whose whole forward and backward over a sequence is ONE autograd op built on
# L3.1's rnn_forward and rnn_backward (the way cuDNN fuses a recurrent layer).
#
# Token arrays are batch first: ids int [B, T]; logits float32 [B, T, V].
# The recurrent state has the shape of the cell's: rnn and gru h
# [n_layers, B, d_h]; lstm (h, c), each [n_layers, B, d_h].
#
# Parameters, in registration order (= state_dict order = the safetensors keys
# of the model directory), float32:
#   emb.weight                          [V, d_emb]     L0.4 Embedding
#   rnn.<the cell's own names>          per layer k: weight_ih_l{k}, weight_hh_l{k},
#                                       bias_ih_l{k}, bias_hh_l{k} (torch's names)
#   out.weight [V, d_h], out.bias [V]                  L0.4 Linear
# All drawn from one rng (a PCG32, M06.3; None means PCG32(0).substream("init"))
# in that order.
#
# Stateful truncated BPTT (Williams and Peng; Zaremba et al. 2014): the
# token stream is cut into `batch` contiguous lanes, lane b = stream[b * L :
# (b + 1) * L] with L = len(stream) // batch (the tail is dropped). Step j
# reads the window [p, p + k) of every lane (inputs) and [p + 1, p + k + 1)
# (targets), starting at p = 0 and advancing p by k. The hidden state left by
# one window starts the next one, DETACHED (the gradient is cut at the window
# boundary, the state is not). When a lane has fewer than k + 1 tokens left,
# p returns to 0 and the state to zeros (a new epoch).
#
# The model directory (save_rnnlm, load_rnnlm) is what `{tinyllm} train
# rnnlm` writes and the L6.7 zoo loads: config.json (formats/config.schema.json)
#   {"tl_arch": "rnnlm", "tl_tokenizer": <tokenizer>, "vocab_size": V,
#    "tl_format": 1, "tl_cell": cell, "tl_d_emb": d_emb, "hidden_size": d_h,
#    "num_hidden_layers": n_layers}
# and model.safetensors: state_dict() as F32 (L0.6's save_safetensors) with
# metadata {"format": "tinyllm", "tl_arch": "rnnlm"}.
