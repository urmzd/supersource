# contracts/py/tinyllm/rnn/lstm.pyi (L3.2): the LSTM, in torch's gate order
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p03-recurrent/02-lstm.md
#
# One step, with x [B, D], state h, c [B, H], and the four gates stacked in
# torch's order i, f, g, o (rows 0:H, H:2H, 2H:3H, 3H:4H of the weights):
#
#     z = x @ w_ih^T + b_ih + h @ w_hh^T + b_hh          [B, 4H]
#     i = sigmoid(z[:, 0:H])      input gate
#     f = sigmoid(z[:, H:2H])     forget gate
#     g = tanh(z[:, 2H:3H])       candidate
#     o = sigmoid(z[:, 3H:4H])    output gate
#     c' = f * c + i * g
#     h' = o * tanh(c')
#
# Every op is from the op library (tinyllm.autograd.functional, L0.2), so the
# backward comes from autograd. Parameter names, shapes, and registration
# order are torch.nn.LSTM's and torch.nn.LSTMCell's, so torch state_dicts
# load by name (L0.4 load_state_dict). Parameters are float32.
#
# Initialization (one `rng`, a PCG32 of M06.3; None means
# PCG32(0).substream("init")), in registration order, for each layer: the
# four gate blocks of w_ih, each xavier_uniform((H, D_in), gain=1) (M07.3),
# then the four blocks of w_hh, each orthogonal_init((H, H), gain=1)
# (M03.3), stacked in the order i, f, g, o. Biases are zero except the
# forget block of b_ih, which is 1 (so f starts near sigmoid(1) = 0.73 and
# the cell remembers by default; torch's own init leaves it at random).
#
# Bidirectional runs are tinyllm.rnn.bi.bidirectional (L3.4) over two LSTMs.
