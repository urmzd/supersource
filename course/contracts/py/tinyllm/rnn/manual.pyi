# contracts/py/tinyllm/rnn/manual.pyi (L3.1): a vanilla RNN with hand-written BPTT
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p03-recurrent/01-vanilla-rnn-manual-bptt.md
#
# Plain numpy, no autograd: the forward keeps every hidden state, and the
# backward walks time in reverse, which is backpropagation through time.
# Row-vector convention (one row per batch element):
#
#     h_t = tanh(x_t @ Wxh + h_{t-1} @ Whh + bh),   t = 0 .. T-1, h_{-1} = h0
#
#   x    [T, B, D]  inputs, time first
#   h0   [B, H]     initial state
#   Wxh  [D, H]     input-to-hidden weights   (torch weight_ih_l0 is Wxh.T)
#   Whh  [H, H]     hidden-to-hidden weights  (torch weight_hh_l0 is Whh.T)
#   bh   [H]        bias                      (torch bias_ih_l0 + bias_hh_l0)
#   h    [T, B, H]  every hidden state, h[t] = h_t
#
# Arithmetic is float64 (inputs are converted). The matmul VJPs come from
# tinyllm.autograd.vjp.matmul_vjp (M08.3) and the spectral radius from
# tinyllm.linalg.eig.spectral_radius (M03.4). L3.6 (`cell='rnn'`) wraps
# rnn_forward and rnn_backward as one fused autograd op.
