# contracts/py/tinyllm/rnn/elmo.pyi (L3.5, optional): ELMo's biLM, ScalarMix, and linear probes
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p03-recurrent/05-elmo-bilm-scalarmix-probes.md
#
# Peters et al. (2018). Two language models read the same sentence: a forward
# LM predicts token t + 1 from tokens 0..t, a backward LM predicts token t - 1
# from tokens t..n-1. Each is a stack of L single-direction LSTMs (L3.2); the
# backward stack reads each sequence reversed inside its own length (L3.4's
# reverse_padded). The two share the token embedding and the softmax.
#
#   e_t        = E[ids_t]                                     [d]
#   f^k_t      = forward LSTM k over f^{k-1} (f^0 = e)         [d]
#   b^k_t      = backward LSTM k over b^{k-1} (b^0 = e)        [d], in source order
#   R^0_t      = [e_t ; e_t],  R^k_t = [f^k_t ; b^k_t]         [2d], k = 1..L
#   fwd logits = out(f^L_t) predicts ids_{t+1};  bwd logits = out(b^L_t) predicts ids_{t-1}
#
# ScalarMix turns the L + 1 layers into one task-specific vector:
#
#   ELMo_t = gamma * sum_k softmax(s)_k R^k_t
#
# with s [L + 1] (zeros at init: every layer weighted equally) and gamma
# [1] (ones), the task's own parameters (AllenNLP's ScalarMix without
# layer norm).
#
# A linear probe asks what a frozen representation already encodes: a
# softmax regression from features to labels, nothing deeper, so its
# accuracy measures the representation, not the probe.
#
# Parameters of BiLM, in registration order (= state_dict order), float32,
# from one rng (PCG32; None means PCG32(0).substream("init")) in this order:
#   emb.weight [V, d]                L0.4 Embedding
#   fwd.<k>.*  for k = 0..L-1        L3.2 LSTM(d, d), torch names (weight_ih_l0, ...)
#   bwd.<k>.*  for k = 0..L-1        L3.2 LSTM(d, d)
#   out.weight [V, d], out.bias [V]  L0.4 Linear, shared by both directions
# Token arrays are batch first: ids int [B, T], lengths int [B] in 1..T.
