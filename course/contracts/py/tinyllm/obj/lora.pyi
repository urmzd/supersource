# contracts/py/tinyllm/obj/lora.pyi (L6.6): LoRA with PiSSA init and merge
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p06-objectives/06-lora-pissa-and-merge.md
#
# Hu et al. (2021), LoRA; Meng et al. (2024), PiSSA. A LoRALinear keeps a
# Linear's weight W [out, in] and bias frozen and adds a trainable low-rank
# update:
#
#   y = x W^T + b + s * B (A (dropout(x)))      s = alpha / r
#   A = lora_A.weight [r, in],  B = lora_B.weight [out, r]
#
# Parameters of a LoRALinear, in registration order (= state_dict order):
#   weight [out, in]   the base Linear's own Tensor, frozen (requires_grad False)
#   bias   [out]       the base's bias, frozen (absent when the base has none)
#   lora_A.weight      L0.4 Linear(in, r, bias=False), built from rng
#   lora_B.weight      L0.4 Linear(r, out, bias=False), built from rng after A
# so a checkpoint of the base loads into the adapted model by name, and the
# keys of a merged model are the base's keys. Freezing is requires_grad False
# on a registered parameter (L0.4 registers at assignment): it stays in
# named_parameters and state_dict, and gets no gradient.
#
# init "default": A as L0.4's Linear init, B = 0, so the adapted model's
# output equals the base's bit for bit.
# init "pissa":  with M03.5's low_rank(W, r) = (P, Q), P Q = W_r the best
# rank-r approximation: B = P / sqrt(s), A = Q / sqrt(s) (so s B A = W_r) and
# weight = W - W_r (the frozen residual), all float32 (computed in float64).
#
# Adapter files use PEFT's key names: "base_model.model.<module name>.lora_A.weight"
# and ".lora_B.weight" (adapter_model.safetensors).
