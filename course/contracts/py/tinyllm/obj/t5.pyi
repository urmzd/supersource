# contracts/py/tinyllm/obj/t5.pyi (L6.4, optional): T5 span corruption and relative position buckets
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p06-objectives/04-t5-span-corruption-and-relative-buckets.md
#
# Raffel et al. (2020). Span corruption picks a noise mask of whole spans,
# T5's random_spans_noise_mask:
#
#   n_noise = clamp(round(L * noise_density), 1, L - 1)       round: half to even (np.round)
#   n_spans = clamp(round(n_noise / mean_noise_span), 1, min(n_noise, L - n_noise))
#   noise lengths = segment(n_noise, n_spans); keep lengths = segment(L - n_noise, n_spans)
#   the text is keep_1, noise_1, keep_2, noise_2, ..., keep_n, noise_n
#
# segment(m, n) splits m items into n positive lengths: a list of m - 1
# flags, the first n - 1 True, shuffled by Fisher-Yates from the end
# (for i = m - 2 down to 1: j = rng.below(i + 1), swap i and j); a segment
# starts after every True flag. The noise lengths are drawn first. (T5
# itself clamps n_spans only from below; the upper clamp keeps every span
# and every gap non-empty for short texts.)
#
# Sentinel k (k = 0, 1, ...) is the id sentinel_start_id - k (T5's
# <extra_id_k> = vocab - 1 - k). inputs: the kept tokens with each noise span
# replaced by its sentinel; targets: each noise span preceded by its
# sentinel. Replacing every sentinel of inputs by what follows it in targets
# gives the original ids back.
#
# Relative positions are key - query (memory_position - context_position).
# Buckets as Hugging Face's T5Attention._relative_position_bucket: with
# n = num_buckets (halved when bidirectional, keys after the query in the
# upper half), offsets below n // 2 get their own bucket, larger ones
#   n // 2 + trunc(log(r / (n // 2)) / log(max_distance / (n // 2)) * (n - n // 2))
# in float32, capped at n - 1.
