# contracts/py/tinyllm/xfmr/masks.pyi (L5.2): attention masks
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p05-transformer-2017/02-masks.md
#
# A mask says which keys each query may read. Every boolean mask here uses
# one convention, the one scaled_dot_product_attention (L5.1) takes:
# True = may attend, False = blocked. Shapes broadcast with numpy rules
# against the scores [..., Tq, Tk]:
#   causal_mask, sliding_window_mask   [Tq, Tk]   (every sequence and head)
#   padding_mask                       [B, T]     (index it as [:, None, None, :]
#                                                  for keys of [B, H, Tq, Tk] scores)
# Query i sits at absolute position q_offset + i and key j at position j,
# so a decode step with a KV cache (L8.2) is causal_mask(1, Tk, q_offset=Tk-1).
# C kernels (L9.3, L9.4) take the same rules as flags: causal, q_offset,
# window.
