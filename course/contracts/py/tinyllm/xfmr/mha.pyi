# contracts/py/tinyllm/xfmr/mha.pyi (L5.3): multi-head attention
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p05-transformer-2017/03-multi-head-attention.md
#
# Vaswani et al. (2017), section 3.2.2. With d_head = d_model / n_heads:
#
#     Q = x_q W_q^T + b_q    K = x_kv W_k^T + b_k    V = x_kv W_v^T + b_v     [B, T, d_model]
#     split: [B, T, d_model] -> [B, T, H, d_head] -> [B, H, T, d_head]
#            (head h owns features h*d_head .. (h+1)*d_head - 1)
#     head_h = softmax(Q_h K_h^T / sqrt(d_head) + mask) V_h                    (L5.1)
#     merge: [B, H, Tq, d_head] -> [B, Tq, H, d_head] -> [B, Tq, d_model]
#     out = merge(heads) W_o^T + b_o
#
# Parameters, in registration order (= state_dict order), float32, each an
# L0.4 Linear(d_model, d_model, bias) drawn from one rng (PCG32; None means
# PCG32(0).substream("init")): q_proj, k_proj, v_proj, out_proj, so the keys
# are q_proj.weight, q_proj.bias, k_proj.weight, ..., out_proj.bias. torch's
# nn.MultiheadAttention packs the first three as in_proj_weight [3 d, d]
# (rows q | k | v); load_packed_in_proj reads that layout.
#
# Masks are bool, True = may attend (L5.2's convention), and broadcast to
# [B, H, Tq, Tk]: a [Tq, Tk] mask applies to every sequence and head, a
# [B, Tq, Tk] mask to every head of its sequence (a head axis is inserted at
# 1), and a [B, H, Tq, Tk] or [B, 1, 1, Tk] mask as it is.
#
# Attention dropout (rate `dropout`) is applied to the weights inside
# scaled_dot_product_attention (L5.1) only in training mode, drawing from
# PCG32(0).substream("dropout"); in eval mode nothing is drawn.
