# contracts/py/tinyllm/xfmr/sdpa.pyi (L5.1): scaled dot-product attention
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p05-transformer-2017/01-scaled-dot-product-attention.md
#
# Vaswani et al. (2017), equation 1, with a hand-written backward:
#
#     S = (Q K^T) * scale            [..., Tq, Tk]   scale defaults to 1 / sqrt(d)
#     S = where(mask, S, -inf)                       mask: bool, True = may attend (L5.2)
#     P = softmax(S, axis=-1)                        tinyllm.num.stable.softmax (M09.2):
#                                                    a fully masked row is zeros
#     O = P V                        [..., Tq, dv]
#
# Backward, for the upstream gradient dO (the shape of O):
#
#     dV = P^T dO
#     dP = dO V^T
#     dS = P * (dP - rowsum(dP * P))                 the softmax VJP (M08.3)
#     dQ = (dS K) * scale            dK = (dS^T Q) * scale
#
# q [..., Tq, d], k [..., Tk, d], v [..., Tk, dv]: the leading (batch, head)
# dimensions must be equal in all three. mask broadcasts to [..., Tq, Tk].
# Arrays keep their float dtype (float32 in, float32 out; float64 for
# gradient checks). L5.3's multi-head attention calls the Tensor version once
# per layer with q, k, v of shape [B, H, T, d_head]; L9.3's C kernel is
# proven against sdpa_forward.
