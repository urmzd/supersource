# contracts/py/tinyllm/dist/zero.pyi (L11.3, optional): data parallelism and ZeRO stages 1 to 3
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p11-training-at-scale/03-ddp-and-zero.md
#
# Every rank (L11.2's Comm) runs the same model on its own slice of the batch.
# DDP keeps a full replica per rank and averages the gradients with one
# all-reduce. ZeRO (Rajbhandari et al. 2020) removes the redundancy: the
# parameters, flattened in parameters() order into one vector of n entries,
# are split by L11.2's chunk_bounds(n, world), and rank r owns chunk r:
#
#   stage 1  optimizer state sharded: all-reduce (mean) the full gradient,
#            update the owned chunk, all-gather the parameters
#   stage 2  + gradients sharded: reduce-scatter (sum, then / world) gives
#            each rank only its chunk's mean gradient; the full .grad
#            arrays are dropped (None) at the step
#   stage 3  + parameters sharded: between steps a rank holds only its
#            chunk; gather() rebuilds the full parameters before forward
#
# The update itself is the wrapped optimizer's, run on one flat
# "parameter" per rank: an object with `data` (the owned chunk, the rank's
# master copy) and `grad`. Elementwise optimizers (SGD, AdamW) then give
# exactly the update a single process computes for those entries.
