# contracts/py/tinyllm/dist/comm.pyi (L11.2, optional): collectives over processes
# chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p11-training-at-scale/02-collectives-over-processes.md
#
# `world` processes, numbered 0 .. world - 1 (the rank), each holding a Comm.
# Point to point: one full-duplex pipe per pair of ranks (multiprocessing
# Pipe); a message is a numpy array, delivered in order. Collectives are
# built from send and recv on a ring (rank r sends to (r + 1) % world and
# receives from (r - 1) % world) and must be called by every rank in the same
# order with arrays of the same shape and dtype.
#
# Chunks: a flat array of n entries splits into `world` contiguous chunks by
# chunk_bounds (the sizes of numpy.array_split: the first n % world chunks
# hold one entry more). Rank r owns chunk r.
#
# Deadlock rule: a send of a large array blocks until the receiver reads it.
# In every ring step, even ranks send then receive and odd ranks receive then
# send, so a ring of any size makes progress.
