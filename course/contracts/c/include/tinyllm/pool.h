/* tinyllm/pool.h (rt.03): a fixed pthread pool and a blocking parallel for.
 * chapter: ml/08-tinyllm/p09-kernels/03-thread-pool-and-parallel-for.md
 * Rules in c/ABI.md.
 *
 * The partition is deterministic: tl_parallel_for(p, n, grain, fn, ctx)
 * calls fn exactly once for each range
 *     [k * grain, min((k + 1) * grain, n))   for k = 0 .. ceil(n / grain) - 1
 * whatever the number of threads. Which worker runs a range, and in which
 * order ranges run, is unspecified. A kernel that reduces within one range
 * and never across ranges is therefore bitwise identical with 1 or 8
 * threads (the rt.03 equivalence test and batch invariance, c/ABI.md rule
 * 10).

 * module: rt.03 (c/src/runtime/pool.c) */
