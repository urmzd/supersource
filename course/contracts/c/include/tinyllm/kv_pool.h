/* tinyllm/kv_pool.h (rt.04): the paged KV block pool, KV format v1.
 * Rules in c/ABI.md; the hash and the export envelope in formats/kv-block.md.
 *
 * The pool owns n_blocks fixed-size blocks. A block holds K and V for
 * block_tokens token positions of every layer and KV head. Each block is in
 * exactly one state, and free + used + cached == n_blocks always holds:
 *
 *   free    refcount 0, not registered: available to tl_kv_alloc
 *   used    refcount >= 1
 *   cached  refcount 0 and registered in the prefix index: reusable by
 *           tl_kv_lookup, evicted least recently used first when tl_kv_alloc
 *           runs out of free blocks
 *
 * The prefix index maps a block hash to a block id (the ds.02 Swiss table)
 * and the cached blocks form an LRU list (ds.03). Only full blocks are
 * registered: a block's fill (tl_kv_set_fill) must equal block_tokens.
 *
 * Not thread-safe: the caller serializes every call on one pool (the Rust
 * engine holds the pool behind one Mutex shared by the step loop and the KV
 * transfer tasks). KV format v2 (fp8 e4m3 with scales) is
 * tinyllm/kv_pool_v2.h, which the craft.13 migration adds to tinyllm.h.
 *
 * module: rt.04 (c/src/runtime/kv_pool.c; craft.13 upgrades it) */
