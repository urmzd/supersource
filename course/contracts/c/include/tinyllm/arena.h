/* tinyllm/arena.h (rt.02): a bump allocator with marks, for kernel scratch
 * (attention tiles, online-softmax rows). Rules in c/ABI.md.
 *
 * An arena is a list of blocks obtained through the allocator hook
 * (tl_alloc). tl_arena_alloc bumps an offset inside the current block and
 * starts a new block when the request does not fit. tl_arena_reset_to
 * rewinds to a mark but keeps every block for reuse, so a steady-state
 * engine step makes zero calls to the hook after warmup (the rt.02 bench
 * counts them).
 *
 * Not thread-safe: the caller serializes every call on one arena.
 *
 * module: rt.02 (c/src/runtime/arena.c) */
