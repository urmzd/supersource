/* tinyllm/attention.h (L9.3, L9.4): FlashAttention forward for prefill and
 * paged attention for decode. Rules in c/ABI.md.
 *
 * Shared definitions. H query heads share Hkv key/value heads (GQA; MHA is
 * Hkv == H, MQA is Hkv == 1); H % Hkv == 0 and query head h reads KV head
 * h / (H / Hkv). Scores are scale * dot(q, k) in f32. A query at absolute
 * position p may see key position j when
 *   causal == 0 or j <= p,  and  window <= 0 or j > p - window.
 * A sink logit, when given, is one extra score per head that joins the
 * softmax denominator and contributes no value (attention sinks); a query
 * with no visible key and no sink outputs zeros and lse = -inf.
 *
 * Both kernels are batch- and chunk-invariant (c/ABI.md rule 10): each
 * output row's reduction over keys runs in tiles aligned to absolute key
 * positions (tile t covers keys [t * Bc, (t + 1) * Bc)), with one fixed
 * order, whatever the batch size, the row's position in the batch, or how
 * the queries were split into calls with q_offset.
 *
 * modules: L9.3 (c/src/kernels/flash_attn.c), L9.4 (c/src/kernels/paged_attn.c) */
