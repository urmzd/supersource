 * beta == 0 writes C without reading it, so NaN or garbage already in C
 * does not propagate. M == 0 or N == 0 is a no-op; K == 0 gives
 * C = beta * C. A pointer may be NULL only when no element is read through
 * it. C must not overlap A or B.
 *
 * Returns TL_OK, or TL_EINVAL (error slot set, C untouched) for a negative
 * dimension, a leading dimension below its minimum, or a NULL pointer that
 * would be read or written.
 *
 * tp may be NULL (serial). v0 ignores tp and may sum over k in any order;
 * course tests compare against numpy within the frozen dot-product bound
 * of close.py. From L9.1 the k order is fixed and independent of M and of
 * the row's position (batch invariance, c/ABI.md). */
