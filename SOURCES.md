# Source Register and Validation

Research pass: **2026-10-06**. Scope: the new [CS curriculum](CS-CURRICULUM.md), foundational math/data books, and the identity/access of the AI engineering book. This is not a completed audit of every claim, link, benchmark, or implementation in the repository.

## Evidence and access

Prefer the author's, publisher's, university's, or standards body's own page. A free companion repository is not a free textbook. “Free to read” does not imply permission to redistribute or relicense. Consult the source's license before copying content; this register links to resources rather than reproducing them.

“Checked” below means the cited official page or document was readable during this pass and supported the listed identity or scope. It does not mean every exercise, download, chapter, or factual statement was independently verified. Live course pages can change; record the semester/version when using them.

## Chip Huyen's books

The likely intended reference is **Chip Huyen**, not “Nyugen”: [AI Engineering: Building Applications with Foundation Models](https://github.com/chiphuyen/aie-book), 2025. The official repository identifies the author/year and links to purchase options, chapter summaries, notes and the [table of contents](https://github.com/chiphuyen/aie-book/blob/main/ToC.md). These are free supporting materials, not the complete commercial book.

The same author describes *Designing Machine Learning Systems* as a companion focused on traditional ML applications, feature engineering and training. Use AIE for foundation-model applications; use DMLS for the broader production ML lifecycle. Both are optional paid references here.

| Reading theme | Local application | Evidence to produce |
|---|---|---|
| Evaluation | [LLM evaluation](ai-platform-engineering/09-llm-evaluation/) | Frozen test set, baseline, error taxonomy, uncertainty |
| Retrieval and context | [Retrieval & RAG](ai-platform-engineering/07-retrieval-and-rag/) | Retrieval metrics and end-to-end answer assessment separately |
| Data quality | [Data engineering](data-engineering/) | Provenance, deduplication and leakage checks |
| Inference and application architecture | [LLM systems](ml/04-llm-systems/) | Quality, latency, throughput and cost under a stated workload |

## Cross-validation protocol

For future source additions, capture: stable source URL, title, authors, edition/date, access category, topic, prerequisite, specific claim or learning outcome, check date, and reviewer. For technical claims, record a section/page or named result and assumptions. Independently recompute quantitative examples or compare with an independent implementation. Two model answers agreeing is not independent evidence when both repeat the same source.

For datasets used in exercises, also record origin, license, collection dates, version/hash, units, schema, missingness, sampling, transformations, train/test split rules and known limitations. Keep raw inputs separate from derived data. Check leakage, duplicate records, out-of-range values, and whether the sample supports the stated conclusion.

When another system reviews a claim, exchange a concrete record:

```text
claim_id:
local_file_and_section:
claim_or_learning_outcome:
primary_source_and_locator:
edition_or_dataset_version:
independent_check_and_result:
disagreement_or_limitation:
reviewer_and_date:
status: pending | supported | corrected | unresolved
```

## Findings and remaining work

| Finding | Resolution / status |
|---|---|
| AI Engineering attribution and access | Official repository supports Chip Huyen (2025); paid text and free companion materials distinguished |
| Degree breadth versus interview tracks | Added explicit core sequence, external courses, coverage boundaries, and capstone requirements |
| Math workload | Paired-course schedule now budgets hours per subject; intensive track is distinguished from full semester study |
| Free access versus open license | Removed the math index's blanket assertion that every linked resource is openly licensed |
| Other-system coordination | Pending: system identity/contact or review output has not been supplied; no second-system agreement is claimed |
| Full repository correctness | Pending: existing technical claims, time estimates, outdated links and edition-specific chapter references still need individual audits |

Retrieval failures during research: the complete CS2023 HTML exceeded the browser's content-size limit; the older Hammack VCU page returned 502. The official CS2023 index and Hammack's current author page were used instead. Crafting Interpreters and a Cornell course URL could not be retrieved and were not promoted to checked sources. These retrieval failures do not establish that the websites are unavailable to other readers.
