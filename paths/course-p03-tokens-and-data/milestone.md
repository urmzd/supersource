# Pass 3 milestones

**Pass result**: corpus pipeline v1 with ledger and decontamination, BPE, WordPiece, and Unigram in Python, BPE in Rust, n-gram/NPLM/word2vec run through {tinyllm}; the engine keeps serving the bigram.

The path includes the milestone stages below. Run each component milestone after its modules pass, then run the pass gate. The component gates run before the pass gate, which also reruns the smoke steps of earlier passes.

## Component gate details

## MS-L1: Your tokenizers match GPT-2 and SmolLM2 exactly, in Python and in Rust

Your tokenizers, run through their own entry points: the Python BPE (L1.2)
trains a vocabulary and encodes exactly like Hugging Face on GPT-2's and
SmolLM2's tokenizer.json; Rust tl-tok (L1.5) independently reads the same
files and is checked against the same frozen id fixtures.

This file fixes the Pass 3 tokenizer verbs of your `tinyllm` and `tl-tok`
roles (spec/cli-roles.md, "Verbs of later passes"). Every verb keeps the
rules of that page: exit 2 on a usage error, the last stdout line is one
JSON object. A texts file ending in .jsonl is JSON lines with a string
"text" (other keys are ignored); any other file is one text per line.

  {tinyllm} tok train --algo bpe --vocab N --in <text file> --out <dir> [--min-freq F] [--special S]...
      Trains your BPETokenizer (L1.2) on the lines of the file and saves
      <dir>/tokenizer.json (the formats/tokenizer.md BPE subset). Final line:
      {"out": "<dir>", "algo": "bpe", "vocab_size": N, "merges": <int>, "bytes_per_token": <float>}
      with bytes_per_token measured on the training file.

  {tinyllm} tok encode --tokenizer <tokenizer.json> --in <texts.jsonl>
      Encodes every text with your Python BPE. Final line:
      {"ids": [every id of every text, in order], "texts": <int>, "tokens": <int>, "bytes_per_token": <float>}

  {tl-tok} encode --tokenizer <tokenizer.json> --in <texts.jsonl>
      Encodes every text with the independent Rust BPE. Its output is
      compared with the same fixture ids as the Python command.

  {tl-tok} bench --tokenizer <tokenizer.json> --in <texts.jsonl> [--threads T] [--repeat R]
      Final line includes {"tokens_per_s": <float>, "batch_speedup": t_serial / t_batch}.

The corpus is course/fixtures/MS-L1/train.txt, a synthetic stand-in for the
TinyStories 5 MB slice, and the vocabulary is 512 (DEVIATIONS B43-07). The
2,000 texts are the first 2,000 of L1.5's golden strings (emoji sequences,
CJK, white-space runs, contractions in every case, Unicode digits); the
expected ids come from Hugging Face tokenizers (course/oracle/L1.5/golden.py).

## MS-corpus: Your corpus pipeline cleans, shards, licenses, and tokenizes a corpus deterministically

(owned by the pass gate's author).

Your `corpus` CLI (data.01 to data.08 composed: fetch, filter, exact and
near dedup, decontamination, PII scrub, shards, ledger, tokens) cleans the
fixture corpus into shards, a manifest, a reconciled ledger, and .bin
token streams that pass the format contracts; the output hash is the same
for 1 and 4 workers in two separate runs; the decontamination count is
recorded; an unlicensed source stops the build with exit 65.

This file fixes the Pass 3 verbs of your `corpus` role (spec/cli-roles.md,
"Verbs of later passes"). Every verb keeps the rules of that page: exit 2
on a usage error, the last stdout line is one JSON object.

  Paths. Every output goes under $TL_ARTIFACTS (the step sets it): corpus/
  (raw/, LEDGER.jsonl, <dataset>/<version>/ with the shards and
  _MANIFEST.json) and tokens/<tokenizer_id>/<dataset>/ (formats/
  corpus-shard.md, formats/tokens-bin.md). In a config, a source url
  without a scheme and a decontam.protected path that is relative resolve
  against the config file's directory. data.01's fetch speaks HTTP only,
  so serve such sources on a loopback port while it runs (the reference
  uses http.server in a thread) and write the documents' urls back as the
  config gave them ("sources/stories.jsonl#12"): the port must not reach
  the shards.

  {corpus} run --config <toml> [--until <stage>] [--workers N]
      Stages fetch, filter (length, lang, gopher, repetition), dedup_exact,
      dedup_near (and decontamination), pii, shard, tokenize; --until stops
      after one (default tokenize). After shard: reconcile the ledger
      (data.08) and verify it; a failed verification exits 65. Final line,
      also written to $TL_ARTIFACTS/corpus/RUN-<dataset>-<version>.json:
      {"dataset", "version", "stage", "n_docs", "n_shards", "filters": {...},
       "exact_dropped", "near_dropped", "decontaminated", "pii_redactions",
       "train_tokens", "val_tokens", "output_sha256"}
      output_sha256 = sha256 of the lines "<path>\t<sha256 of the file>\n",
      sorted by path, for every file under corpus/<dataset>/<version>/ and
      tokens/<tokenizer_id>/<dataset>/, paths relative to $TL_ARTIFACTS.
      No time, absolute path, port, or worker count may appear in the line.

  {corpus} ledger verify --config <toml>
      data.08's check() on corpus/LEDGER.jsonl and the config's corpus;
      exit 0, or 65 with the problems on stderr.

  {corpus} datasheet --config <toml>
      data.08's datasheet() on stdout (with the tokens directory when it
      exists).

The fixture (course/oracle/MS-corpus/make_fixtures.py) plants what each
stage removes: 2 too short, 2 French, 1 repetitive, 4 verbatim copies, 5
one-word edits, 3 documents holding a 15-word span of the protected
stories, and 5 PII matches; 169 documents remain (140 stories, 24 notes,
5 stories whose PII is scrubbed). The token counts are those of the byte
tokenizer under the document-hash split with val_permille 100, which the
contracts fix, so every correct pipeline prints the same numbers.

`ss milestone MS-corpus --smoke` runs the smoke steps (all of them: this
milestone needs no services). Every later pass gate reruns them.

## MS-L2: Your n-gram and neural language models, trained and scored through your CLI

Your statistical language models, run through your own entry point: a
Kneser-Ney 4-gram (L2.1) trained and scored to within 0.5% of the exact
reference perplexity, then Bengio's NPLM (L2.2) trained with your autograd
to the reference's calibrated perplexity (below the count bigram's), and
generation from the NPLM that repeats itself exactly for a fixed seed. Both
scores are reported in bits per byte (M00.1, through M11.2's accumulator).
word2vec (L2.3) has no step here: its call site is the L6.7 zoo.

This file fixes the Pass 3 language-model verbs of your `tinyllm` role
(spec/cli-roles.md, "Verbs of later passes"). Every verb keeps the rules of
that page: exit 2 on a usage error, the last stdout line is one JSON object.
Token files are formats/tokens-bin.md shards of byte ids (the byte
tokenizer, D32), so one token is one byte.

  {tinyllm} lm train ngram --n N --train <tokens.bin> --out <dir> [--discount modified|D]
      Fits your NGramLM (L2.1) on the whole file as ONE sequence (one <s>
      before its first token), V = 256, and writes <dir>/model.safetensors
      (NGramLM.save) and <dir>/config.json
      {"tl_arch": "ngram", "tl_tokenizer": "bytes", "vocab_size": 256, ...}.
      Final line: {"out": "<dir>", "arch": "ngram", "n": N, "tokens": <int>}

  {tinyllm} lm train nplm --train <tokens.bin> --out <dir> --context C --d-emb M
                --hidden H --steps S --batch B --lr X [--momentum MU]
                [--weight-decay WD] [--clip G] [--no-direct] [--seed S]
      Builds NPLM(256, C, M, H, direct=not --no-direct, rng=PCG32(S).substream("init")),
      trains it with train_nplm (L2.2) for exactly S steps on the windows of
      the whole file, shuffled by PCG32(S).substream("shuffle"), and writes
      the model directory with save_nplm (tokenizer "bytes").
      Final line: {"out": "<dir>", "arch": "nplm", "steps": S, "loss": <float>, "params": <int>}
      with loss the mean training loss of the last 50 steps.

  {tinyllm} eval --model <dir> --data <tokens.bin>
      Scores the file as ONE sequence with the model its config.json names
      (tl_arch ngram: every token, the first from <s>; nplm: every token with
      a full window) and sums the per-token NLLs with M11.2's NLLAccumulator,
      one byte per token. Final line:
      {"model": "<tl_arch>", "ppl": <float>, "nll_mean": <float>, "bpb": <float>,
       "tokens": <int>, "bytes": <int>}

  {tinyllm} generate --model <nplm dir> --prompt <text> --seed S --max-tokens N [--greedy] [--out <file>]
      The Pass 1 verb (spec/cli-roles.md) on an nplm directory: NPLM.generate
      (L2.2) from the prompt's bytes at --temperature (default 1.0). With
      --out, the final line is also written to <file>.

The corpus is a synthetic stand-in for the TinyStories files of the design
(course-corpora/ts-train.bin and ts-val.bin are not published; DEVIATIONS
B54-01): course/fixtures/MS-L2/{train,val}.bin, 141 532 and 14 675 bytes of
short stories generated by course/oracle/MS-L2/corpus.py. The KN-4 bar comes
from the exact-fraction oracle course/oracle/MS-L2/kn4_ref.py:
ppl = 1.8699475121183176176, so ppl <= 1.005 x that and
nll_mean >= ln(0.995 x that). The bigram bar is the same oracle family's
add-one count bigram (L0.0) fitted on train.bin: 2.142401587 nats per byte on
val.bin (course/oracle/MS-L2/corpus.py).

`ss milestone MS-L2 --smoke` runs every step (no services, under a minute).

## MS-P3: Tokens and data: deterministic corpus, tokenizers, and language models

Compose tokenizer, corpus, and language-model component gates. The additional
`requires` entries are the Pass 3 foundations outside those component gates.

The pass-gate planner reruns smoke steps of every earlier pass gate.

Run a gate with `practice/bin/ss milestone <ID> --smoke`; omit `--smoke` for its full local and cluster steps.
