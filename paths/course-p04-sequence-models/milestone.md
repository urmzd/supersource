# Pass 4 milestones

**Pass result**: RNN/LSTM/GRU LMs, seq2seq with attention, beam search in the CLI.

The path includes the milestone stages below. Run each component milestone after its modules pass, then run the pass gate. The component gates run before the pass gate, which also reruns the smoke steps of earlier passes.

| Gate | Specification | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `MS-L3` | [`MS-L3.toml`](../../course/milestones/MS-L3.toml) | Your recurrent language models, trained, ordered, and scored through your CLI. Requires `L3.1`, `L3.2`, `L3.3`, `L3.4`, `L3.6`. |
| `MS-L4` | [`MS-L4.toml`](../../course/milestones/MS-L4.toml) | Your encoder-decoders translate dates, and attention closes the gap. Requires `L3.4`, `L4.1`, `L4.2`, `L4.3`, `L4.4`, `L4.5`, `craft.07`. |
| `MS-P4` | [`MS-P4.toml`](../../course/milestones/MS-P4.toml) | Sequence models: recurrent language models and attentive translation. Requires `M07.4`, `S-M07c`. |


## Component gate details

## MS-L3: Your recurrent language models, trained, ordered, and scored through your CLI

Your recurrent language models, run through your own entry point: an Elman
RNN (L3.1, fused as one op by L3.6), an LSTM (L3.2), and a GRU (L3.3), each
trained with stateful truncated BPTT (L3.6) on Tiny Shakespeare, the LSTM
sampling text, and the LSTM trained on the MS-L2 story corpus and scored on
its validation file, where it must beat the MS-L2 NPLM in bits per byte.
L3.4 (the bidirectional encoder) is exercised by MS-L4.

This file fixes the Pass 4 language-model verbs of your `tinyllm` role
(spec/cli-roles.md, "Verbs of later passes"); exit 2 on a usage error, the
last stdout line is one JSON object. Text files are read as UTF-8 bytes,
.bin files as formats/tokens-bin.md shards of byte ids (D32).

  {tinyllm} train rnnlm --cell rnn|lstm|gru --data <file> --out <dir> --steps S --seed S
                --d-emb E --hidden H --bptt K --batch B --lr X --clip G
      The last 10% of the file's tokens (int(n * 0.1)) are held out. Builds
      RNNLM(256, E, H, cell, rng=PCG32(seed).substream("init")), trains it
      with train_tbptt(model, head, K, B, AdamW(lr=X, weight_decay=0), G, S)
      and writes the model directory with save_rnnlm (tokenizer "bytes").
      Final line: {"out", "arch": "rnnlm", "cell", "steps": S, "loss": <mean
      of the last 50 losses>, "val_bpc": <mean nll of the tail, in bits>,
      "val_tokens", "params"}

  {tinyllm} eval --model <rnnlm dir> --data <file> [--tail-frac F]
      RNNLM.nll over the file (or over its last int(n * F) tokens), summed
      with M11.2's NLLAccumulator, one byte per token. Final line:
      {"model": "rnnlm", "ppl", "nll_mean", "bpb", "tokens", "bytes"}

  {tinyllm} generate --model <rnnlm dir> --prompt <text> --seed S --max-tokens N [--out <file>]
      RNNLM.generate from the prompt's bytes at --temperature (default 1).
      Final line {"ids", "text"}, also written to <file> with --out.

Bars. A json-last-line metric compares with a constant or the reference's
calibrated bar (mean + 3 sd over 5 seeds, ref-thresholds.tsv), never with
another step, so the two comparisons of the design are fixed constants
(DEVIATIONS B63-07): in the full run the RNN's bpc must stay ABOVE the
LSTM's calibrated full bar (so a passing RNN and a passing LSTM are always
ordered RNN > LSTM), and the LSTM's bits per byte on MS-L2's val.bin must be
below 0.6261, the best of five reference NPLMs trained with MS-L2's config
(0.6261 to 0.6559 bpb). Both are `ci = "nightly"` steps; --smoke runs the
300-step variants with their own calibrated bars.

Corpora: course/fixtures/small-corpora/tinyshakespeare.txt (Karpathy's
char-rnn file, public domain) and MS-L2's synthetic stand-in for the
TinyStories token files (course-corpora is not published; DEVIATIONS
B54-01, B63-06).

`ss milestone MS-L3 --smoke` takes about a minute; the full run about 5.

## MS-L4: Your encoder-decoders translate dates, and attention closes the gap

Your encoder-decoders, run through your own entry point: three seq2seq
models (L4.1, its bidirectional encoder from L3.4) trained on the dates
task, without attention, with Bahdanau's (L4.2), and with Luong's (L4.3),
then decoded with your beam search (L4.4) and graded with your sequence
metrics (L4.5). It requires craft.07, the deepened L4.5 suite.

This file fixes two Pass 4 verbs of your `tinyllm` role (spec/cli-roles.md,
"Verbs of later passes"); exit 2 on a usage error, the last stdout line is
one JSON object. Task files hold one `source<TAB>target` pair per line.

  {tinyllm} train seq2seq --task <pairs.tsv> --attn none|bahdanau|luong --out <dir> --steps S --seed S
                --d-emb E --hidden H --d-attn A --batch B --lr X --clip G
      One L1.1 CharTokenizer over every source and target, specials
      <pad>, <bos>, <eos>, shared by both sides. One init = PCG32(seed)
      .substream("init") builds the attention module (bahdanau:
      AdditiveAttention(H, H, A); luong: LuongAttention(H, "general"))
      and then Seq2Seq(V, V, E, H, "gru", attention). Each of S steps takes
      the next B pairs of an order shuffled per epoch by
      PCG32(seed).substream("shuffle"), and runs L0.5's train_step on the
      teacher-forced cross-entropy (padding targets ignored) with AdamW(lr=X,
      weight_decay=0) and clip G. Writes save_seq2seq and tinyllm_char.json.
      Final line: {"out", "arch": "seq2seq", "attn", "steps", "loss", "params"}

  {tinyllm} translate --model <seq2seq dir> --in <pairs.txt> --beam K
      Decodes every source with your beam_search (beam K, max 16 tokens)
      over decode_step, and again greedily (beam 1); scores both against the
      targets with your exact_match. Final line:
      {"model", "beam", "n", "em", "em_lo", "em_hi" (metric_ci, 1000
       resamples, PCG32(0)), "em_greedy", "em_gain" (em - em_greedy),
       "em_long", "em_short" (sources of at least / under 20 characters),
       "n_long", "chrf"}

Bars, all constants (a metric is compared with a constant, never with
another step; DEVIATIONS B63-07): each attention model reaches EM 0.97
overall and on the long bucket; the model without attention stays at or
below 0.87 on the long bucket, so the gap is at least 0.1 (the lesson); and
on that model beam 5 beats greedy (em_gain > 0; with attention both decode
every date, so there is nothing to gain). The model without attention gets
twice the steps (600) and still trails: the bottleneck, not the budget. The
reference over seeds 0 to 4: attention EM 0.995 to 1.0 after 300 steps; no
attention after 600 steps 0.26 to 0.82 on the long bucket, em_gain 0.003
to 0.027 (after 300 steps beam lost to greedy on one seed of five, which
is why the weaker model trains longer).

The design's full configuration fits the PR budget (three trainings of 300
to 600 steps, 10 to 40 s each), so --smoke runs every step (DEVIATIONS B63-08).
Data: course/fixtures/small-corpora/dates.tsv (8000 pairs) and
dates-test.txt (600 held-out pairs, 184 with a source of 20 characters or
more), original synthetic dates from course/oracle/MS-L4/dates.py.

## MS-P4: Sequence models: recurrent language models and attentive translation

Compose the recurrent-model and sequence-to-sequence component gates. The
two prerequisite stages are part of Pass 4 but outside those gate requires.
Earlier pass gates' smoke steps rerun as part of the spiral invariant.

Run a gate with `practice/bin/ss milestone <ID> --smoke`; omit `--smoke` for its full local and cluster steps.
