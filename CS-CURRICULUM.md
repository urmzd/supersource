# Computer Science: Foundations to Specialization

A degree-shaped self-study curriculum: programming, mathematics, theory, computer systems, data, software engineering, and a substantial capstone. This is a learning plan, not an accredited degree or a claim that all university requirements are implemented here. The short track schedules are introductions or refreshers, not substitutes for semester courses.

Use the [source register](SOURCES.md) for textbook identity, access, and validation evidence. The breadth checklist is informed by [ACM/IEEE-CS/AAAI CS2023](https://csed.acm.org/knowledge-areas/); the sequencing, projects, and assessment rules below are Supersource's recommendations, not requirements quoted from that standard.

## Entry requirements and pacing

Start with algebra, functions, exponentials/logarithms, and trigonometry. If these are unfamiliar, work through those topics before calculus. No prior programming is required for the first term. Read technical English, use a terminal, and learn Git alongside programming.

The eight terms below describe ordering, not guaranteed completion dates. Budget roughly 12-15 weeks per term and 8-12 hours per active subject each week; three subjects imply 24-36 hours per week before a capstone. These are planning estimates. At 10 hours total per week, take one subject at a time. Advance on demonstrated competence, not elapsed weeks.

| 8 | [Distributed systems](systems/), [data engineering](data-engineering/), specialization and capstone | OS, networking, databases, software engineering; specialization-specific math | Failure-injection report; reproducible pipeline; defended capstone with results and limitations |

Practice technical writing, accessibility, privacy, attribution, and professional responsibility throughout. Include a stakeholder-impact analysis in each substantial project. Study concurrency on one machine before distributed execution. A type-systems survey alone does not complete a programming-languages course.

## Breadth audit

These are **coverage judgments**, not certification of CS2023 learning outcomes. “Local” means relevant material exists, not that a full semester or an independently graded assessment is available. External courses fill gaps in this plan; their existence does not mean their content has been imported.

| Algorithmic foundations | Local algorithms + Erickson + MIT theory | Formal computability/complexity supplied externally |

| Specialized platform development | Local cloud, infrastructure and edge inference | Mobile/embedded breadth remains an elective gap |

## Mathematics must produce working artifacts

For each lab: state assumptions, derive the method, implement a small version, compare against a known answer or independent library, and explain where it fails. These are assignment specifications, not prebuilt graded exercises.

| Foundation | Application | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Logic, sets, relations, induction | Dependency scheduler and permissions graph | Correct topological order or cycle witness; invariant proof; disconnected and cyclic cases |
| Counting, recurrences, modular arithmetic | Dynamic programming and hashing | Derive recurrence and complexity; enumerate small cases independently; distinguish collisions from equality |
| Linear systems, projections, eigenvectors, SVD | Least squares and PCA | Compare QR/SVD solution with a library; measure residual and reconstruction error; test rank deficiency; avoid explicit normal-equation inversion |
| Derivatives and Taylor approximation | Root finding and one-dimensional optimization | Compare analytic derivatives with central differences over several step sizes; report nonconvergence and cancellation |
| Integration and series | Numerical quadrature and probability normalization | Compare against an analytic integral; measure error as resolution changes; state convergence assumptions |
| Multivariable calculus and chain rule | Logistic regression or a tiny neural network | Derive gradients; finite-difference check on a smooth objective; show training loss and held-out performance separately |
| Probability and inference | Queue simulation and A/B experiment | Seeded replications; estimated uncertainty; assumptions about sampling and independence; false-positive simulation |
| Optimization and numerical analysis | Regularized regression and gradient descent | Compare with closed-form or library reference; learning-rate and conditioning experiment; stopping criterion |

Use [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) to connect linear algebra, vector calculus, probability, and optimization to regression, PCA, and mixture models. It complements the foundational books. It is not a replacement for learning proof or elementary calculus.

For AI engineering, read **Chip Huyen, AI Engineering: Building Applications with Foundation Models (2025)** as an optional paid companion. Her [official repository](https://github.com/chiphuyen/aie-book) provides free supporting materials. Use its evaluation, RAG, data, and inference topics with the local platform modules. Read *Designing Machine Learning Systems* for the broader traditional ML lifecycle. Neither book replaces math, algorithms, or systems foundations.

## Completion gate

Keep a portfolio containing solved unseen problems, proofs, executable projects, raw measurements, and short technical reports. For each subject, explain one failure case without consulting the solution. Have an independent reviewer assess correctness, assumptions, and reproducibility; record unresolved disagreements. Automated checks verify behavior but do not establish conceptual understanding.

The final capstone must include a research question, source and dataset provenance, a baseline, an experiment plan fixed before final evaluation, reproducible commands, tests, limitations, and a presentation. Reserve a held-out dataset or workload. Do not tune on it and then report it as an independent test. Include writing, teamwork and broader science/humanities study separately when using this as preparation for university-level education.
