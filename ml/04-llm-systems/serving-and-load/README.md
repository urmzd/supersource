# Serving, Capacity & Load Testing: Math → Code

How to size, configure, benchmark, and explain an LLM deployment, organized as **math first, then the code and engine flags that implement it**. Written for the engineer who inherits a customer deployment from an ML or performance engineer at an inference cloud and must defend every number to both a researcher and a buyer. Engine flags reviewed against the vLLM and SGLang docs in October 2026.

## Key Takeaways

- **Decode is a bandwidth problem, prefill is a compute problem.** A decode step reads every weight once to produce one token per sequence, so `tok/s per sequence ≤ HBM bandwidth / bytes per step`. Batching amortizes that read, which is the whole economic engine of an inference cloud
- **Memory decides concurrency.** After weights, every remaining byte is KV cache, and `KV/token = 2 × layers × kv_heads × head_dim × bytes`. Concurrency, context length, and cost per token all fall out of that one division
- **SLOs are distributions.** TTFT and TPOT at p99 under a stated arrival process are the contract; mean throughput at infinite load is a marketing number. Report **goodput**: requests per second that meet every SLO
- **Every knob moves a point along one curve.** Bigger batches raise throughput and raise TPOT; chunked prefill trades a little TTFT for stable TPOT; speculative decoding buys latency at low load and costs throughput at high load
- **Benchmark open loop with realistic lengths, a warmup, and no accidental prefix-cache hits**, then show the customer the latency-throughput curve and the cost per 1M tokens at their SLO point

## How to Study

- Run [`code/capacity.py`](code/capacity.py) for the model your customer asked about before reading anything else, then derive each printed line by hand
- Run [`code/loadgen.py`](code/loadgen.py) `--mock --sweep` and watch TTFT p99 explode once offered load passes capacity; then repeat against a real `vllm serve` on one GPU
- For each engine flag, write down which term of the memory budget or the step-time equation it changes. If you cannot, you do not yet understand the flag
- Read Orca, then PagedAttention, then Sarathi-Serve, then DistServe in that order: each fixes the bottleneck the previous one exposed

# Concepts & Techniques

## Core Insight

A serving engine runs a loop: pick a batch of sequences, run one forward pass, append one token to each (or a chunk of prompt for prefilling ones), repeat. The **step time** of that loop is

```
t_step ≈ max( FLOPs_step / (peak_FLOPs × MFU),  bytes_step / (HBM_BW × MBU) ) + t_comm + t_overhead
bytes_step ≈ W_active / N_gpu + Σ_seq ctx_seq × KV_tok / N_gpu
```

Every metric a customer cares about is a function of that equation: TPOT is `t_step` during decode, TTFT is queueing plus the prefill steps, throughput is `batch / t_step`, and cost is `$/hr / throughput`. Every engine knob changes a term of it (batch size, bytes per weight, bytes per KV element, `N_gpu`, how prefill tokens are mixed in). The FDE's job is to know which term dominates for this customer's traffic and move that one.

## 1. Prefill vs Decode: The Roofline

**Key ideas**:
- **Arithmetic intensity** `I = FLOPs / bytes moved`. The **roofline** says attainable throughput is `min(peak_FLOPs, I × BW)`. The **ridge point** `I* = peak / BW` separates memory-bound (`I < I*`) from compute-bound
- **H100 SXM**: 989 TFLOP/s dense BF16, 1979 dense FP8, 3.35 TB/s HBM3. So `I* ≈ 295 FLOP/B` for BF16 and `≈ 590 FLOP/B` for FP8. H200 keeps the FLOPs and raises bandwidth to 4.8 TB/s, which is why it decodes faster at the same price class
- **Linear layers dominate FLOPs**: for a `d_in × d_out` weight and `T` tokens in the step, FLOPs `= 2 T d_in d_out`, weight bytes `= b d_in d_out`, so `I ≈ 2T / b`. At BF16 (`b = 2`), **intensity equals the number of tokens in the step**
- **Prefill**: `T` = prompt length (e.g. 2048), so `I ≈ 2048 ≫ 295`. Compute-bound. Lower bound on prefill time: `t ≈ 2 P n / (peak × MFU)`. Llama-3.1-8B, 2048 tokens: `2 × 8e9 × 2048 / 989e12 ≈ 33 ms` at 100% MFU, roughly 50-60 ms in practice
- **Decode**: `T` = batch size `B` (one new token per sequence). At `B = 1`, `I ≈ 1`: the GPU is about 300x underused on compute. The step costs one full read of the weights plus the KV history
- **Decode bound**: `tok/s per sequence ≤ BW × MBU / (W/N + ctx × KV_tok / N)`. Llama-3.1-8B BF16 on one H100: `3.35e12 / 16.06e9 ≈ 209 tok/s` from weights alone, about 202 with a 4k-token KV history. Real engines reach **MBU** of 60-85%
- **Batch effect**: increasing `B` adds only KV bytes per step (weights are shared), so aggregate tok/s rises almost linearly until either (a) the KV reads dominate, (b) KV memory runs out, or (c) `B` approaches `I*` and decode turns compute-bound. Attention itself never batches: each sequence reads its own KV, intensity about 1 (GQA raises it to the group size)
- **MoE**: per-token FLOPs scale with **active** params, but at large batch nearly every expert is touched each step, so bytes per step trend toward **total** params. MoE is cheap at high batch and expensive at batch 1

Math → code: the decode section of `capacity.py`.

```python
w_read = m.active * a.weight_bytes / n_gpus              # weights touched per step, per GPU
step_bytes_b = w_read + batch * avg_ctx * kv_tok_per_gpu  # plus every sequence's KV history
t_mem_b = step_bytes_b / (hbm_bw * mbu)
t_cmp_b = 2 * m.active * batch / (peak * tp)              # linear-layer FLOPs
agg_tok_s = batch / max(t_mem_b, t_cmp_b)
```

## 2. The Memory Budget

**Key ideas**:
- **Weights**: `W = params × bytes/param`. BF16 = 2, FP8/INT8 = 1, INT4 ≈ 0.5 plus group scales. Sharded `W/TP` per GPU under tensor parallelism
- **KV cache per token**: `KV_tok = 2 × L × n_kv × d_head × b_kv`. The 2 is K and V. Sharded across TP ranks by KV head, but **replicated** once `TP > n_kv`
- **GQA** shrinks `n_kv`: Llama-3.1-8B has 32 query heads but 8 KV heads, so 128 KiB/token instead of 512 KiB under MHA. That 4x is 4x the concurrent users
- **MLA** (DeepSeek-V2/V3) caches one compressed latent per layer shared by all heads: `KV_tok = L × (d_c + d_rope) × b = 61 × (512 + 64) × b`. At FP8 that is 34.3 KiB/token for a 671B model, smaller than the 8B Llama at BF16. The latent is **replicated** across TP ranks, which is why DeepSeek deployments use DP attention (SGLang `--enable-dp-attention`) or decode context parallelism (vLLM `--decode-context-parallel-size`)
- **Activation headroom**: the engine profiles a forward pass at `max_num_batched_tokens` at startup, plus CUDA graph pools and NCCL buffers. Budget 1-4 GiB per GPU; more for large vocabularies (the logits tensor is `tokens × vocab × 4 B`)
- **Budget**: `KV_pool = util × M_gpu − W/N − activations`. vLLM's `--gpu-memory-utilization` and SGLang's `--mem-fraction-static` set `util`
- **Concurrency**: `max_tokens = KV_pool / KV_tok_per_gpu`; `max_seqs = max_tokens / ctx`. With PagedAttention the context that counts is the **live** one, not `max_model_len`: requests only hold the blocks they have filled

**Worked example**: H100 80 GiB, `util = 0.90`, 2 GiB reserve, 8,192-token sequences. Output of `capacity.py`:

| Config | GPUs | Weights/GPU | KV pool/GPU | KV/token/GPU | Max KV tokens | Seqs @ 8k | Single-stream bound |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|---------------------|
| 8B BF16, BF16 KV | 1 | 14.96 GiB | 55.04 GiB | 128 KiB | 450,912 | 55 | 202 tok/s |
| 8B FP8, FP8 KV | 1 | 7.48 GiB | 62.52 GiB | 64 KiB | 1,024,352 | 125 | 404 tok/s |
| 70B BF16 | 1 | 131.5 GiB | does not fit | | | | |
| 70B BF16, TP=2 | 2 | 65.75 GiB | 4.25 GiB | 160 KiB | 27,844 | 3.4 | 47 tok/s |
| 70B BF16, TP=4 | 4 | 32.88 GiB | 37.12 GiB | 80 KiB | 486,596 | 59 | 94 tok/s |
| 70B FP8, FP8 KV | 1 | 65.75 GiB | 4.25 GiB | 160 KiB | 27,844 | 3.4 | 47 tok/s |
| 70B FP8, FP8 KV, TP=2 | 2 | 32.88 GiB | 37.12 GiB | 80 KiB | 486,596 | 59 | 94 tok/s |

Read the table the way a customer will: **70B BF16 on 2 GPUs technically fits and is useless** (3 concurrent 8k sequences). FP8 on TP=2 gives the same concurrency as BF16 on TP=4 at half the GPUs, which is why FP8 (with an accuracy check, see [Quantization](../quantization/)) is the default recommendation for 70B-class dense models on Hopper.

```bash
python code/capacity.py --preset llama-3.1-70b --tp 2 --weight-bytes 1 --kv-bytes 1
```

## 3. Metrics, SLOs, and Little's Law

**Key ideas**:
- **TTFT** (time to first token): queueing + prefill (+ network). Governs perceived responsiveness for chat and streaming UIs
- **TPOT** (time per output token) `= (E2E − TTFT) / (n_out − 1)`, a per-request average. **ITL** (inter-token latency) is each individual gap; its p99 exposes stalls that the TPOT average hides (a long prefill scheduled into the batch freezes every decoding stream for one step)
- **E2E latency** `≈ TTFT + TPOT × (n_out − 1)`. What batch and agent workloads care about
- **Throughput**: output tok/s (decode capacity), total tok/s (input + output, for prefill-heavy RAG), req/s. Always say which
- **Goodput** ([DistServe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09670)): the max request rate at which at least X% of requests meet **both** the TTFT and TPOT SLOs. It is the number that sets the price
- **Percentiles**: p50 for typical experience, p99 for the contract. p99 of a mean is meaningless; compute percentiles over requests (or over individual ITL gaps), never over per-second averages
- **The latency-throughput curve**: plot TPOT p50/p99 and TTFT p99 against achieved throughput as offered load rises. TPOT rises slowly (bigger batches), then TTFT goes vertical when arrival rate exceeds service rate and the queue grows without bound. The usable operating point is the knee, before the vertical
- **Little's law**: `L = λ × W`. Mean in-flight requests equals arrival rate times mean time in system. At 10 req/s and 6 s mean E2E, 60 requests are in flight: you need `--max-num-seqs ≥ 60` **and** a KV pool for `60 × mean context` tokens, or the excess queues and TTFT grows
- **Utilization and queueing**: for an M/M/1-like server, mean wait grows as `ρ / (1 − ρ)`. At 90% utilization the queue is 9x the service time; at 95% it is 19x. Size for 60-75% of measured saturation on bursty traffic

| Workload | Primary SLO | Typical targets (illustrative) | What to optimize |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------------|------------------|
| Chat UI | TTFT p99, TPOT p50 | TTFT < 500 ms, TPOT < 30-50 ms (faster than reading) | Prefix caching, chunked prefill, moderate batch |
| Code completion | TTFT p99, E2E | TTFT < 200 ms, short outputs | Small model, spec decoding, low batch |
| RAG / long-context QA | TTFT at long inputs | TTFT < 2 s at 32k input | Prefill throughput, prefix cache, disaggregation |
| Agents / tool loops | E2E per turn | Many sequential calls, each adds TTFT | Prefix caching across turns, spec decoding |
| Offline batch | Cost per 1M tokens | Throughput only | Max batch, FP8, `--max-num-seqs` high |

## 4. Parallelism: TP, PP, DP, EP, CP, and Disaggregation

**Key ideas**:
- **Tensor parallelism (TP)** ([Megatron-LM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08053)): split each matmul across `N` GPUs. Weights and KV per GPU shrink by `N`, so **per-token latency drops**. Cost: 2 all-reduces per layer of `T × d × b` bytes, ring time `≈ 2(N−1)/N × size / link_BW`. Needs NVLink: H100 NVLink 4 gives 900 GB/s per GPU versus about 64 GB/s per direction for PCIe Gen5 x16. Keep TP inside one NVLink domain (8 GPUs on HGX, 72 on GB200 NVL72)
- **Pipeline parallelism (PP)**: split layers into stages. One point-to-point send per stage boundary per microbatch, so it tolerates PCIe and InfiniBand (NDR: 400 Gb/s ≈ 50 GB/s per port). Does not reduce single-request latency and adds bubbles; use it to span nodes when a model will not fit in one NVLink domain
- **Data parallelism (DP)**: independent replicas behind a load balancer. Throughput scales linearly, latency unchanged, no communication. The default for anything that fits on one GPU or one TP group: two TP=1 replicas of an 8B model beat one TP=2 replica on throughput per GPU
- **Expert parallelism (EP)**: for MoE, place whole experts on different GPUs and route tokens with all-to-all. Avoids TP's per-expert matmul slicing (small experts slice badly). Usually combined with DP attention: attention runs data-parallel, MoE layers run expert-parallel. vLLM `--enable-expert-parallel` with `--data-parallel-size`; SGLang `--ep-size` with `--enable-dp-attention`
- **Context / sequence parallelism (CP)**: split one long sequence's tokens across GPUs (ring attention style) for prefill of 128k+ prompts, or shard its KV for decode. vLLM exposes `--prefill-context-parallel-size` and `--decode-context-parallel-size`
- **Disaggregated prefill/decode**: run prefill and decode on separate GPU pools and ship the KV cache between them. Rationale ([DistServe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09670), [Splitwise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18677)): the phases interfere (a prefill stalls every decode in the batch) and want different parallelism and even different hardware. [Mooncake](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00079) (Kimi) adds a KV-cache-centric store across DRAM/SSD so prefixes are computed once cluster-wide
- **KV transfer cost** decides whether disaggregation pays: shipping `n × KV_tok` bytes must take less than the decode interference it removes. 8k tokens of 70B BF16 KV is `8192 × 320 KiB ≈ 2.7 GB`: about 54 ms at 50 GB/s RDMA, which is why this needs RDMA (NIXL, Mooncake transfer engine) and not TCP
- **Implementations**: vLLM `--kv-transfer-config` with connectors (NIXL, LMCache, Mooncake); SGLang `--disaggregation-mode prefill|decode`; [NVIDIA Dynamo](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo) orchestrates disaggregated vLLM, SGLang, or TensorRT-LLM workers with a KV-aware router and a planner that rebalances prefill vs decode GPUs

| Strategy | Reduces latency | Raises throughput | Interconnect need | Use when |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| DP | No | Yes, linear | None | Model fits one GPU or one TP group |
| TP | Yes | Per replica | NVLink | Model too big for one GPU, or TPOT SLO too tight |
| PP | No | Yes, with bubbles | PCIe / IB fine | Model too big for one node |
| EP (+ DP attn) | Somewhat | Yes for MoE | NVLink / fast IB all-to-all | Large MoE (DeepSeek, Qwen-MoE, Llama-4) |
| CP | Yes for long prefill | No | NVLink | 128k+ contexts |
| P/D disaggregation | Stabilizes TPOT and TTFT | Yes at scale | RDMA | Long prompts, strict TPOT, many replicas |

**Worked TP communication cost** (Llama-3.1-70B decode, batch 64, BF16, TP=4 on NVLink):

```
per all-reduce:   T × d × b = 64 × 8192 × 2 B          = 1.05 MB
ring traffic:     2(N−1)/N × 1.05 MB = 1.5 × 1.05 MB   = 1.57 MB per GPU
per layer:        2 all-reduces                        = 3.1 MB
per step:         80 layers                            = 252 MB
time at ~450 GB/s effective NVLink (one direction)     ≈ 0.56 ms
time at ~50 GB/s effective PCIe Gen5                   ≈ 5 ms
```

Against a memory-bound step of roughly 16 ms (see `capacity.py --preset llama-3.1-70b --tp 4`), NVLink adds about 3%; PCIe adds about 30%, before latency effects of 160 small collectives. This is why TP across PCIe-only cards (L40S boxes) is usually capped at 2, and why replicas (DP) beat TP there.

## 5. Engine Knobs

**Key ideas**:
- **Continuous batching** ([Orca](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi22/presentation/yu)): schedule per iteration, not per request; sequences join and leave the batch every step. Every modern engine does this
- **PagedAttention** ([2309.06180](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180)): KV in fixed-size blocks with a block table, so memory is allocated as tokens arrive. Removes fragmentation and enables block sharing for prefixes
- **Chunked prefill** ([Sarathi-Serve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02310)): cap tokens per step (`max_num_batched_tokens`); long prompts are split into chunks and co-scheduled with decodes. Bounds the step time, so ITL p99 stays flat. Smaller budget: better ITL, worse TTFT for long prompts. Larger: the reverse
- **Prefix caching**: hash KV blocks by token content (vLLM) or keep a radix tree of prefixes (SGLang **RadixAttention**). System prompts, few-shot examples, multi-turn chat, and agent loops get TTFT near zero for the cached part. SGLang `--schedule-policy lpm` (longest prefix match) orders the queue to maximize hits
- **Preemption**: when the KV pool fills mid-generation, the engine evicts a sequence and recomputes it later. Visible as TPOT spikes and a preemption counter in metrics. Fix with more KV memory, lower `--max-num-seqs`, or FP8 KV

**TensorRT-LLM** compiles (or, with its PyTorch backend, loads) the model with fused kernels tuned per GPU and serves through `trtllm-serve` with an OpenAI-compatible API. It typically wins on NVIDIA hardware at fixed shapes and loses on iteration speed when the customer changes models weekly. **NVIDIA Dynamo** is a layer above engines: an OpenAI-compatible frontend, a KV-aware router that sends a request to the worker already holding its prefix, disaggregated P/D with NIXL transfers, and a planner that scales prefill and decode pools on SLO signals.

**Symptom to knob** (diagnose with the engine's Prometheus metrics first):

| Symptom | Likely cause | Knob |
|---------|--------------|------|
| TTFT p99 spikes under load, TPOT fine | Queueing: arrival rate near capacity | Add replicas (DP), raise `--max-num-seqs` if KV allows |
| ITL p99 spikes when long prompts arrive | Prefill stalls decode | Lower `--max-num-batched-tokens` / `--chunked-prefill-size`; at scale, disaggregate P/D |
| TTFT high for long prompts at low load | Prefill compute | Raise chunk budget, TP, or CP; FP8 weights; prefix caching for shared context |
| TPOT high at low load | Bandwidth per GPU | TP up, FP8/INT4 weights, speculative decoding, H200/B200 |
| TPOT degrades steadily with load | Batch growing, KV reads dominate | Cap `--max-num-seqs`; FP8 KV; accept the curve |
| Preemptions / recompute in logs | KV pool exhausted | `--kv-cache-dtype fp8`, raise `util`, lower `--max-num-seqs` or `--max-model-len`, add TP |
| OOM at startup | Profiling or CUDA graph capture | Lower `util` / `--mem-fraction-static`, lower `--max-num-batched-tokens` |
| Low prefix-cache hit rate on chat | Unstable prompt prefix, or replicas not prefix-aware | Put static content first; use prefix-aware routing (SGLang router, Dynamo, llm-d) |
| GPU util high, tok/s low | CPU-bound scheduler, tiny batches, detokenization | `--async-scheduling`, more API server processes, check client |
| Throughput fine, cost too high | Over-provisioned for SLO | Find goodput knee, run nearer it, consider FP8 or a smaller model |

## 6. Speculative Decoding

**Key ideas**:
- **Idea** ([Leviathan et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17192)): a cheap drafter proposes `γ` tokens; the target model verifies all `γ + 1` positions in one forward pass (decode is memory-bound, so verifying 5 tokens costs about the same bytes as producing 1). Rejection sampling keeps the output distribution **exactly** the target's
- **Expected tokens per target step** with per-token acceptance rate `α` (assumed i.i.d.): `E[tokens] = (1 − α^(γ+1)) / (1 − α)`
- **Speedup**: `S = E[tokens] / (1 + γ c)`, where `c` is the drafter's step cost relative to the target. Example: `α = 0.8`, `γ = 4`: `E = (1 − 0.328) / 0.2 = 3.36`; with `c = 0.05` (EAGLE-sized head), `S = 3.36 / 1.2 = 2.8x`
- **When it hurts**: at high batch the target step is already near the ridge point. Verification multiplies tokens per step by `γ + 1`, so once compute-bound the step costs about `(γ + 1)x` and `S → E / (γ + 1) = 3.36 / 5 = 0.67`: a 33% slowdown. Rule: big win at low concurrency, neutral to negative at high concurrency. Measure `α` on the customer's traffic, not on a benchmark
- **Drafter families**:

| Method | Drafter | `α` driver | Engine support |
|--------|---------|------------|----------------|
| Draft model | Small model of the same family (e.g. 1B for 70B) | Family similarity | vLLM `draft_model`, SGLang `STANDALONE` |
| [Medusa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10774) | Extra decoding heads on the target | Head training | Largely superseded by EAGLE |
| [EAGLE-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01840) | One-layer head on target's multi-layer features, trained with test-time simulation | Fused low/mid/high features | vLLM `eagle3`, SGLang `EAGLE3` |
| MTP ([DeepSeek-V3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19437)) | Multi-token-prediction modules trained with the model | Native | vLLM `mtp`, SGLang `NEXTN` |
| N-gram / prompt lookup | Copy spans from the prompt | Output repeats input (RAG, code edit, summarization) | vLLM `ngram`, SGLang `NGRAM` |
| Suffix decoding | Suffix trees over prompt and prior outputs | Repetitive agent loops | vLLM `suffix` |

- **Configure low**: start at `num_speculative_tokens` 2-3; the acceptance-weighted gain flattens fast while the high-batch penalty grows linearly in `γ`

## 7. Multi-LoRA, Serverless vs Dedicated, Cold Start, Autoscaling

**Key ideas**:
- **Multi-LoRA**: one base model, many adapters `ΔW = B A` with rank `r`. Adapter size `= r × (d_in + d_out) × modules × L × b`. Llama-3.1-8B, `r = 16`, all 7 projections: about 42M params, 84 MB at BF16, versus 16 GB for a full fine-tune. [Punica](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18547) introduced **SGMV**, a kernel that batches requests for different adapters in one launch; [S-LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03285) pages adapters between host and GPU in a unified pool with the KV cache. Cost: extra FLOPs proportional to `r` and a throughput hit that grows with the number of distinct adapters per batch (`--max-loras` / `--max-loras-per-batch`)
- **Serverless** (shared, per-token pricing): the provider multiplexes many customers per GPU; the customer gets no cold starts on popular models but no control of batch, SLO isolation, or custom weights. **Dedicated** (per GPU-hour): isolation, custom weights and flags, predictable latency; the customer pays for idle
- **Break-even**: dedicated is cheaper when sustained tokens per hour exceed `GPU $/hr ÷ serverless $/token`. At $2.50/hr and $0.20 per 1M tokens: `2.50 / 0.20e-6 = 12.5M tokens/hr ≈ 3,470 tok/s` sustained per GPU. Below that, serverless wins; above, dedicated wins if you can actually run near that utilization
- **Cold start**: `t ≈ image pull + weights / storage_BW + engine init (profiling, CUDA graphs, torch.compile)`. 140 GB of 70B BF16 at 1 GB/s from object storage is 140 s; at 7 GB/s local NVMe, 20 s. Mitigations: weights cached on node NVMe, streaming loaders (vLLM `--load-format runai_streamer`), pre-compiled graph caches, warm pools, and LoRA instead of full fine-tunes so the base stays resident
- **Autoscaling signals**: queue depth (`vllm:num_requests_waiting`, `sglang:num_queue_reqs`), KV utilization (`vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc`, `sglang:token_usage`), and TTFT p99 versus SLO. **Not CPU or GPU util**: GPU util reads near 100% at batch 1 and at batch 200 alike
- **Scale-to-zero** saves money only if cold start is inside the customer's tolerance. Pair it with a minimum replica of 1 during business hours, and scale on queue depth with a lead time larger than cold start

## 8. Load Testing Methodology

**Key ideas**:
- **Closed loop** (N concurrent users, each sends after the previous response): self-throttling, so a slow server receives fewer requests and latency looks fine. Good for "what does 64 concurrent users feel like" (`--max-concurrency`). **Open loop** (arrivals at rate `λ` regardless of responses): exposes queueing, which is what production traffic does. Default to open loop
- **Poisson arrivals**: inter-arrival gaps `~ Exp(λ)`. Real traffic is burstier; vLLM's `--burstiness < 1` (gamma inter-arrivals) models that. Replay a production trace (vLLM `timed_trace` dataset, AIPerf Mooncake trace format) when the customer has one
- **Length distributions**: input and output lengths drive everything. Use the customer's histogram; otherwise lognormal, not fixed. Force output length with `ignore_eos` so runs are comparable, and say you did
- **Warmup**: send a few requests first and exclude them (CUDA graphs, JIT, allocator pools)
- **Prefix-cache contamination**: reusing identical prompts across runs or rates measures cache hits, not prefill. Randomize every prompt (a unique nonce at the start), or disable prefix caching, unless caching is what you are testing; then test it deliberately with a fixed shared prefix
- **Client bottlenecks**: a Python single-process client tops out at a few thousand streaming connections. Watch client CPU; NVIDIA replaced GenAI-Perf with the multiprocess [AIPerf](https://docs.nvidia.com/aiperf/getting-started/migrating-from-gen-ai-perf) for this reason
- **Tools**: `vllm bench serve` (`--request-rate`, `--burstiness`, `--max-concurrency`, `--goodput ttft:500 tpot:40`, `--percentile-metrics`, `--metric-percentiles`), `python -m sglang.bench_serving` (same shape, `--random-range-ratio`), AIPerf / GenAI-Perf for engine-agnostic runs, and [`code/loadgen.py`](code/loadgen.py) to understand what they compute

Math → code: the open-loop arrival process in `loadgen.py`.

```python
theta = 1.0 / (rate * args.burstiness)
next_t += rng.gammavariate(args.burstiness, theta)   # burstiness=1 is Exp(rate): Poisson
time.sleep(max(0.0, next_t - time.perf_counter()))
threading.Thread(target=one_request, args=(...)).start()  # never wait on completions
```

Verified offline (`--mock` fake engine, ITL grows with batch, max 64 running):

```text
$ python code/loadgen.py --mock --sweep 2,8,32 --num-requests 120 --output-len 48 --endpoint chat \
      --slo-ttft-ms 300 --slo-tpot-ms 25
  rate  out tok/s  goodput  ttft p50  ttft p99  tpot p50  tpot p99
     2         87     1.69      22.3     167.4      12.8      14.4
     8        229     4.41      28.3     178.2      14.0      16.4
    32        373     4.43     177.6     391.2      23.0      27.4
```

Throughput keeps rising from rate 8 to 32 while goodput stays flat and TTFT p99 crosses the SLO: the knee is between them. That table, plotted, is the deliverable.

**Presenting results to a customer**:
- One chart: x = achieved output tok/s (or req/s), y = TTFT p99 and TPOT p99, one point per offered rate, SLO lines drawn. Mark the operating point
- State the setup: model, precision, GPU type and count, engine and version, flags, input/output length distribution, arrival process, prefix-cache state, warmup
- **Cost per 1M output tokens** at the operating point: `$/1M = (GPU $/hr × N_gpu) / (tok/s × 3600) × 1e6`

**Worked cost example** (assumed $2.50 per H100-hour):

| Deployment | Throughput at SLO | Formula | $ per 1M output tokens |
|------------|-------------------|---------|------------------------|
| 8B FP8, 1x H100, roofline bound (`capacity.py`, batch 125) | 10,070 tok/s | `2.50 / (10070 × 3600) × 1e6` | $0.069 |
| 8B FP8, 1x H100, measured at TPOT p99 < 40 ms (illustrative) | 4,000 tok/s | `2.50 / (4000 × 3600) × 1e6` | $0.174 |
| 70B FP8, 2x H100, measured (illustrative) | 1,500 tok/s | `5.00 / (1500 × 3600) × 1e6` | $0.926 |

**Same result, two audiences**:

| Question | To a researcher | To a customer |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Why is TPOT 23 ms at peak? | Memory-bound at 70% MBU: 33 GiB of weights plus about 19 GiB of KV read per GPU per step at 3.35 TB/s | About 40 tokens per second per user, several times faster than anyone reads |
| Why not more throughput? | KV pool is full at 59 sequences of 8k; past that we preempt | Beyond ~60 simultaneous long chats per replica, latency breaks your SLO, so we add a replica |
| Why FP8? | Halves weight and KV bytes; accuracy delta measured on your eval set | Same answers on your test set, half the hardware, half the price |
| Why not speculative decoding? | At batch 60 we are near the ridge; verification costs `γ + 1` tokens of compute | It helps quiet hours, hurts peak hours; we enable it on the low-traffic tier |

The gap between the first two rows of the cost table is the honest conversation: the bound assumes 100% MBU, 100% busy, and no SLO. Quote the measured number and explain the bound as the ceiling. Price input tokens separately: they cost prefill FLOPs, about `2P` per token, and are usually 3-10x cheaper per token than output.

## 9. Runbook: From Customer SLO to Deployment Config

1. **Collect**: model (and acceptable quantization), traffic shape (peak and mean req/s, input and output length histograms, shared-prefix fraction), SLOs (TTFT p99, TPOT p99 or E2E), region and data constraints, budget
2. **Fit**: run `capacity.py` for candidate precision and TP. Pick the smallest TP whose KV pool holds `Little's L × mean context × 1.5` tokens. Prefer FP8 weights on Hopper/Blackwell after an accuracy check on the customer's eval
3. **Check the TPOT floor**: single-stream decode bound × 0.7 MBU must beat the TPOT SLO with margin. If not, raise TP, quantize, add speculative decoding (if concurrency is low), or move to H200/B200
4. **Check the TTFT floor**: prefill time for p99 input length `≈ 2 P n / (peak × 0.5)` must fit inside the TTFT SLO with room for queueing. If not: TP or CP, prefix caching, or disaggregation
5. **Configure**: set `--max-model-len` to the real p99.9 context, not the model max; `--max-num-seqs` from Little's law; `--max-num-batched-tokens` 2k-8k (smaller for strict ITL); prefix caching on; FP8 KV if KV-bound
6. **Measure one replica**: open-loop sweep with the customer's length distribution; find goodput at the SLO
7. **Scale out**: replicas `= ceil(peak req/s ÷ goodput per replica ÷ 0.7)` for headroom. Prefix-aware routing if shared prefixes matter. Disaggregate P/D only when long prompts and strict TPOT coexist at enough scale to keep both pools busy
8. **Autoscale and alert** on queue depth and KV utilization; alert on TTFT/TPOT p99 against SLO; track preemptions
9. **Report**: the curve, the config, the cost per 1M tokens, and the one-line explanation of which term of the step-time equation binds

**Example**: support chatbot, Llama-3.1-70B, peak 20 req/s, input lognormal mean 2k (1.5k shared system prompt), output mean 300, TTFT p99 < 800 ms, TPOT p99 < 50 ms. Little: `E2E ≈ 0.3 + 300 × 0.04 ≈ 12 s`, so `L ≈ 240` in flight at peak, `240 × 2.3k ≈ 550k` KV tokens. FP8 on TP=2 holds about 487k at 80 KiB/token, so plan two replicas minimum before measuring; 94 tok/s single-stream bound gives about 15 ms TPOT at 70% MBU, well under 50 ms. Config: `vllm serve ... -tp 2 --quantization fp8 --kv-cache-dtype fp8 --max-model-len 8192 --max-num-seqs 160 --max-num-batched-tokens 4096 --enable-prefix-caching`, behind a prefix-aware router so the 1.5k system prompt is prefilled once per replica. Then measure, and let goodput set the replica count.
