# Part 0: Foundations

The model side of the tracer and, from Pass 2, the autograd engine every later model trains with. Pass 1 has one chapter: a byte-level bigram fitted by counting, whose logits use NumPy matmul and whose weights you write as a safetensors checkpoint the Rust engine serves. Pass 2 retrains the same bigram with your autograd (L0.5 takes over `bigram.py`) behind the same checkpoint contract.

**Course passes**: 1 (L0.0, gate [MS-P1](../../../paths/course-p01-tracer/milestone.md)), 2 (L0.1 to L0.6, gate MS-P2).

**Before you start**: [Python and NumPy](../../../software-craftsmanship/12-language-and-tool-primers/01-python-and-numpy.md) and [matrix multiplication in Python](../../../math/03-linear-algebra/01-vectors-matrices-and-matmul.md).
