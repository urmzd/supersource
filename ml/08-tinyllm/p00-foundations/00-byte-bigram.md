## Key Takeaways

- A bigram language model is one table: row $i$ is the distribution of the next byte after byte $i$, and add-alpha smoothing makes every row a proper distribution with no zeros (`test_rows_sum_to_one`).
- The negative log-likelihood of the count model is a closed form in the counts, and it is the number every later model in this course must beat (`test_hand_example_nll`, `test_nll_matches_counts`).
- Indexing the table by token ids picks its rows exactly, so NumPy returns the model's logits bit for bit (`test_logits_are_weight_rows`).
- Sampling is temperature, softmax, one uniform draw, and an inverse CDF; a seed makes it repeatable (`test_sample_is_seeded`, `test_sample_frequencies_match_model`).
- Your safetensors file is byte-identical to the reference library's, so your Rust engine (and anyone else's reader) loads it (`test_matches_library_bytes`).

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start L0.0              # stubs bigram.py and safetensors.py into your repo
ss tests L0.0              # read the test catalog first: rung R0, you write no tests here
ss check L0.0              # exit code is the verdict
ss check L0.0 --ref-deps   # only if a Python prerequisite is not passing yet
ss diff  L0.0              # after passing: your code against the reference
```

You also write the first verbs of your own CLI, `python/tinyllm/__main__.py` (it is yours: the course ships no CLI). [`spec/cli-roles.md`](../../../course/contracts/spec/cli-roles.md) fixes what `MS-P1` will run:

| Verb | What it does with this module |
|---|---|
| `train bigram --data F --out DIR [--alpha A]` | reads the bytes of `F` as ids, calls `fit_counts`, writes `DIR/model.safetensors` (`bigram.weight`, metadata `{"format": "tinyllm"}`) and `DIR/config.json`, prints `{"out", "tokens", "nll"}` as the last line |
| `generate --model DIR --prompt P [--max-tokens N] [--greedy \| --temperature T] [--seed S]` | `load_safetensors`, `BigramLM(weight)`, `sample(list(P.encode()), N, T, S)`, prints `{"ids", "text"}` |
| `logits --model DIR --prompt P [--prefix-ids ...]` | `logits(ids)[-1]` as a JSON list |

`config.json` for the tracer is exactly `{"tl_arch": "bigram", "tl_tokenizer": "bytes", "vocab_size": 256, "tl_format": 1}`.

**The Python project.** `python/` is a uv project that is not an installed package, and the CLI runs as a script from the repo root. Three files set it up (`ss start` writes none of them; they are yours):

```toml
# python/pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "tinyllm"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = ["numpy>=2.0"]

[tool.uv]
package = false
```

```python
# python/tinyllm/__init__.py is empty. python/tinyllm/__main__.py starts with:
import sys
from pathlib import Path

if __package__ in (None, ""):  # run as a script: put python/ on the path
    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]))

from tinyllm.lm.bigram import BigramLM  # noqa: E402
```

Then declare the role in `system.toml` and try it:

```toml
[entry]
tinyllm = ["uv", "run", "--project", "python", "python", "python/tinyllm/__main__.py"]
```

```bash
uv run --project python python python/tinyllm/__main__.py train bigram --data some.txt --out artifacts/bigram
uv run --project python python python/tinyllm/__main__.py generate --model artifacts/bigram --prompt Once --greedy
```

`ss check L0.0` grades the two library units only; the CLI is an entry point (D16), which `MS-P1` runs.

## 1. Why now

The Rust engine you write next (`L10.0`) needs a model directory to serve, the Go gateway (`gw.00`) needs that engine behind it, and the cluster (`dep.00`) needs both. Today `{tinyllm} train bigram` does not exist and there is no checkpoint on disk, so every layer above Python has nothing to load. This module builds the smallest real language model, computes logits with a NumPy row gather, and writes the file format every later model uses. From here on, the tracer bullet has a payload.

## 2. Principles

This section is "just enough" math, defined from scratch. Each idea comes back properly later: functions, `log`, and `exp` in `M00.1`; probability and random variables in `M07.1`; maximum likelihood in `M07.2`; entropy, cross-entropy, and perplexity in `M11.1`; stable softmax in `M09.2`.

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $V$ | vocabulary size: the number of distinct token ids (256 for bytes) | `int` |
| $x_1, \dots, x_T$ | the training text as token ids, $x_t \in \{0, \dots, V-1\}$ | `int64[T]` |
| $C_{ij}$ | count of positions $t$ with $x_t = i$ and $x_{t+1} = j$ | `float64[V, V]` |
| $R_i = \sum_j C_{ij}$ | how often $i$ appears as a context (followed by something) | `float64[V]` |
| $\alpha > 0$ | smoothing constant (add-one: $\alpha = 1$) | `float` |
| $P(j \mid i)$ | the model's probability that $j$ follows $i$ | `float64` in $(0, 1)$ |
| $W_{ij} = \ln P(j \mid i)$ | the weight table, stored as logits | `float32[V, V]` |
| $\mathrm{softmax}(z)_j = e^{z_j} / \sum_k e^{z_k}$ | turns any real row $z$ into probabilities | `float64[V]` |
| $\mathrm{NLL}$ | mean negative log-likelihood, nats per predicted token | `float` |
| $\tau \ge 0$ | sampling temperature | `float` |
| $F_j = \sum_{k \le j} p_k$ | cumulative distribution (CDF) of a row $p$ | `float64[V]` |
| $u$ | one uniform random number in $[0, 1)$ | `float` |

**Bytes are tokens.** Text is stored as UTF-8 bytes, and each byte is a number from 0 to 255. The tracer uses the byte itself as the token id (decision D32, [`tokenizer.md`](../../../course/contracts/formats/tokenizer.md)), so $V = 256$, there is no tokenizer file, and `"hi"` is the ids `[104, 105]`. A character such as `é` takes two bytes, so it is two tokens.

**A language model predicts the next token.** Given the text so far, it returns a probability for each of the $V$ possible next tokens. The **bigram** assumption is the bluntest one that works: only the previous token matters, $P(x_{t+1} \mid x_1, \dots, x_t) \approx P(x_{t+1} \mid x_t)$. So the whole model is a $V \times V$ table: row $i$ is the distribution of what follows $i$.

**Counts to probabilities.** Slide over the text and count each adjacent pair $(x_t, x_{t+1})$ into $C_{x_t, x_{t+1}}$. Row index = where you are, column index = what comes next. The natural estimate is the observed frequency, $P(j \mid i) = C_{ij} / R_i$. It is the maximum-likelihood estimate (`M07.2` proves it): no other table gives the training text a higher probability.

**Zeros break it, so smooth.** A pair that never occurs gets probability 0, and a byte that never occurs as a context has $R_i = 0$, which makes its whole row $0/0$. Add-alpha smoothing pretends every pair was seen $\alpha$ extra times:

$$P(j \mid i) = \frac{C_{ij} + \alpha}{R_i + \alpha V}.$$

Each row still sums to one, because $\sum_j (C_{ij} + \alpha) = R_i + \alpha V$: the denominator must add $\alpha$ once for each of the $V$ columns, not once. An unseen context gets the uniform row $\alpha / (\alpha V) = 1/V$.

**Store logs, not probabilities.** The natural logarithm $\ln$ turns products into sums, $\ln(ab) = \ln a + \ln b$, and $\exp$ undoes it, $e^{\ln p} = p$. The model stores $W_{ij} = \ln P(j \mid i)$, called **logits**. Every later model in the course also outputs logits, and turns them into probabilities with softmax. For a row of log-probabilities, softmax gives the probabilities back exactly: $e^{\ln p_j} / \sum_k e^{\ln p_k} = p_j / 1$. Softmax also ignores a constant added to every entry, $\mathrm{softmax}(z + c) = \mathrm{softmax}(z)$, which is why you compute it as $e^{z_j - \max z}$: the largest exponent becomes $e^0 = 1$ and nothing overflows.

**Negative log-likelihood measures fit.** Under the bigram assumption, the probability of the whole text (after its first token) is the product $\prod_{t=1}^{T-1} P(x_{t+1} \mid x_t)$. That number underflows for any real text, so take its log and average:

$$\mathrm{NLL} = -\frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \ln P(x_{t+1} \mid x_t).$$

There are $T - 1$ predictions, because the first token has no context. The unit is **nats per token** (natural log). Lower is better; a model that knows nothing (uniform over 256 bytes) scores $\ln 256 \approx 5.545$. For the count model the sum regroups by pair: $\mathrm{NLL} = -\frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{i,j} C_{ij} \ln P(j \mid i)$, a closed form your autograd bigram in `L0.5` must reach by gradient descent.

**Logits by row gather.** A one-hot vector $e_i$ has a 1 at position $i$ and 0 elsewhere. Multiplying it by the table selects row $i$: $(e_i W)_j = \sum_k [k = i] W_{kj} = W_{ij}$. NumPy expresses the same operation directly as `weight[ids]`, producing the $T \times V$ logits without constructing a $T \times V$ one-hot matrix or doing $T \cdot V \cdot V$ multiply-adds. `L10.0` computes the same row selection in Rust.

**Temperature.** To sample, divide the logits by $\tau$ before softmax: $p = \mathrm{softmax}(z / \tau)$. With log-probabilities $z = \ln q$ this gives $p_j \propto q_j^{1/\tau}$. At $\tau = 1$ you sample the model as is; $\tau < 1$ sharpens it (at $\tau = 0.5$, $p \propto q^2$); $\tau > 1$ flattens it. $\tau = 0$ is defined as **greedy**: take the largest logit, and on a tie the lowest id (decision D11, so every implementation agrees).

**Sampling by inverse CDF.** To draw $j$ with probability $p_j$, build the running sum $F_j = p_0 + \dots + p_j$ (so $F_{V-1} = 1$), draw one uniform $u \in [0, 1)$, and return the smallest $j$ with $F_j > u$. The interval of $u$ values that lands on $j$ is $[F_{j-1}, F_j)$, whose length is exactly $p_j$. One draw per token, from a generator you created once with a seed, makes the same seed give the same text. The tracer may use `numpy.random.default_rng(seed)`; `L0.5` switches to your own PCG32 (`M06.3`) so Python and Rust agree.

**The file.** A safetensors file is an 8-byte little-endian length $N$, then $N$ bytes of JSON describing each tensor (dtype, shape, byte offsets), padded with spaces to a multiple of 8, then the raw tensor bytes back to back, little-endian and row-major. The full rules, including the order a canonical writer uses so its bytes match the reference library, are in [`safetensors.md`](../../../course/contracts/formats/safetensors.md). The tracer checkpoint holds one tensor, `bigram.weight`, F32 `[256, 256]`.

## 3. Worked example by hand

Take a three-letter alphabet so the table fits on paper: `a = 0`, `b = 1`, `c = 2`, so $V = 3$. The text is `abbacab`, ids `[0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1]`, $T = 7$.

**Pairs.** Six adjacent pairs: `ab`, `bb`, `ba`, `ac`, `ca`, `ab`.

**Counts** (row = current, column = next):

| | a | b | c | $R_i$ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| a | 0 | 2 | 1 | 3 |
| b | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 |
| c | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

**Add one** ($\alpha = 1$, so each row total grows by $\alpha V = 3$) and divide:

| | a | b | c |
|---|---|---|---|
| a | 1/6 = 0.1667 | 3/6 = 0.5 | 2/6 = 0.3333 |
| b | 2/5 = 0.4 | 2/5 = 0.4 | 1/5 = 0.2 |
| c | 2/4 = 0.5 | 1/4 = 0.25 | 1/4 = 0.25 |

Every row sums to 1. The weight table is the natural log of each entry, for example $W_{ab} = \ln 0.5 = -0.6931$ and $W_{aa} = \ln(1/6) = -1.7918$.

**NLL.** The six predictions and their costs $-\ln P$:

| $t$ | context $\to$ next | $P$ | $-\ln P$ |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | a $\to$ b | 3/6 | $\ln 2 = 0.6931$ |
| 2 | b $\to$ b | 2/5 | $\ln 2.5 = 0.9163$ |
| 3 | b $\to$ a | 2/5 | $\ln 2.5 = 0.9163$ |
| 4 | a $\to$ c | 2/6 | $\ln 3 = 1.0986$ |
| 5 | c $\to$ a | 2/4 | $\ln 2 = 0.6931$ |
| 6 | a $\to$ b | 3/6 | $\ln 2 = 0.6931$ |

Sum: $3 \ln 2 + 2 \ln 2.5 + \ln 3 = 2.0794 + 1.8326 + 1.0986 = 5.0106$. Divided by 6: $\mathrm{NLL} = 0.8351$ nats per token, better than the uniform model's $\ln 3 = 1.0986$.

**Logits by row gather.** For ids `[0, 2]`, `weight[ids]` is rows `a` and `c` of $W$, unchanged.

**Greedy.** From `a` the largest entry is `b` (0.5). From `b`, `a` and `b` tie at 0.4, and ties go to the lowest id, so `a`. Then `b`, then `a`: greedy from `[a]` for 4 tokens is `[1, 0, 1, 0]`.

**Temperature 0.5 on row `a`.** $q^2 = (1/36, 9/36, 4/36)$, which renormalizes to $(1/14, 9/14, 4/14)$: `b` goes from 50% to 64%.

**Inverse CDF on row `a`.** $F = (1/6, 4/6, 1) = (0.1667, 0.6667, 1)$. A draw $u = 0.10$ gives `a` (the first $F_j > 0.10$), $u = 0.50$ gives `b`, $u = 0.90$ gives `c`.

**The file.** The format page works out a 120-byte file by hand: one tensor `w = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]` with metadata `{"format": "tinyllm"}`. Its header is 93 bytes of JSON, padded with 3 spaces to $N = 96$; the file is $8 + 96 + 16 = 120$ bytes, ending in `00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 40 00 00 40 40 00 00 80 40` (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 as little-endian float32).

These numbers are the first cases in section 4: `test_hand_example_probabilities`, `test_hand_example_nll`, `test_greedy_ties_go_to_lowest_id`, and `test_worked_example_bytes`.

## 4. The interface

```python
# python/tinyllm/lm/bigram.py
class BigramLM:
    weight: NDArray                                   # float32 [V, V], log P(j | i)
    def __init__(self, weight: ArrayLike | None = None) -> None
    @property
    def vocab_size(self) -> int
    def fit_counts(self, ids: ArrayLike, vocab_size: int, alpha: float = 1.0) -> None
    def logits(self, ids: ArrayLike) -> NDArray       # [T, V] = W[ids]
    def nll(self, ids: ArrayLike) -> float
    def sample(self, prefix: list[int], n: int, temperature: float, seed: int) -> list[int]

# python/tinyllm/io/safetensors.py (v0: F32 only)
def save_safetensors(path: str, tensors: dict[str, NDArray], meta: dict[str, str]) -> None
def load_safetensors(path: str) -> tuple[dict[str, NDArray], dict[str, str]]
```

The contracts carry the exact rules: which errors are `ValueError`, that `sample` returns only the new ids, and that an empty `meta` omits `__metadata__`. For input ids $i_0, \dots, i_{T-1}$, `logits` is the row gather `weight[ids]`, with output shape $T 	imes V$.

### What the tests check

| Test | KIND | Checks | Why it matters downstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test_hand_example_probabilities` | unit | the section 3 table, from `weight` and from `logits` | you and the test agree on the definition |

| `test_weight_is_checked_not_converted` | boundary | a float64, non-square, 1-D, `inf`, or `nan` weight is a `ValueError`; `vocab_size` before a table is a `RuntimeError` | a bad checkpoint fails at load, not inside the matmul |
| `test_logits_are_weight_rows` | differential | `logits(ids) == weight[ids]` bit for bit, float32 `[T, V]` | the forward pass `L10.0` reproduces |

| `test_sample_frequencies_match_model` | statistical | 6000 transitions fit the table (chi-square, $p > 10^{-3}$) | the sampler draws the model, not something near it |
| `test_temperature_sharpens` | statistical | at $\tau = 0.5$ transitions fit $q^2$ renormalized | temperature divides |
| `test_sample_rejects_bad_args` | boundary | empty prefix, $\tau < 0$, $n < 0$ are `ValueError` | bytes have no start token |
| `test_worked_example_bytes` | unit | the 120-byte file of section 3 | header length, padding, byte order |
| `test_matches_library_bytes` | golden | six files byte-identical to the pinned `safetensors` library | any reader, including your engine, loads your checkpoint |
| `test_bytes_are_little_endian_row_major` | boundary | a transposed view and a `>f4` array write row-major little-endian bytes | arrays in memory are not always in file order |
| `test_save_rejects_non_f32` | boundary | float64, int32, float16, a `__metadata__` tensor, a non-string value | v0 writes F32 only |
| `test_load_reads_library_files` | golden | every library file loads to the exact inputs | `generate` loads the checkpoint |
| `test_roundtrip` | property | `load(save(x)) == x`, writable float32 | checkpoints survive a round trip |
| `test_load_rejects_bad_files` | boundary | gap, trailing bytes, wrong size, short file, duplicate key, F16, a JSON array header, a non-string `__metadata__` value | a reader never trusts the header |
| `test_load_caps_the_header_length` | boundary | an otherwise valid file with $N = 100{,}000{,}001$ | a corrupt length cannot make the reader parse gigabytes |

## 5. Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Caught by |
|---|---|---|
| 1. no smoothing ($\alpha = 0$) | `-inf` logits for unseen pairs; a row of `nan` for a byte never seen as a context; `0 * -inf = nan` inside the matmul | `test_alpha_must_be_positive` (mutant `m01`) |
| 2. counting `C[next, cur]` | the model predicts the previous byte; the hand table comes out transposed | `test_counts_direction` (mutant `s02`) |
| 3. trusting ids | `-1` silently counts into the last row (numpy wraps negative indexes) | `test_rejects_out_of_range_ids` (mutant `s03`) |
| 4. reading logits as log-probabilities in `nll` | correct for the count model, wrong the day `L0.5` stores trained logits | `test_nll_normalizes_logits` (mutant `s10`) |
| 5. a one-hot matrix multiply in `logits` | allocates an unnecessary $T 	imes V$ array instead of gathering rows | `test_logits_are_weight_rows` |
| 6. seeding a new generator at every step | still repeatable, but every step draws the same $u$, so the text follows one quantile of each row | `test_sample_frequencies_match_model` (mutant `s09`) |
| 7. writing the array's memory as is | a transposed view writes columns; a big-endian array writes swapped bytes | `test_bytes_are_little_endian_row_major` (mutants `s15`, `s16`) |
| 8. a reader that trusts the header | reads past a gap or ignores trailing bytes, so a corrupt checkpoint loads | `test_load_rejects_bad_files` (mutants `s20`, `s21`) |
| 9. smoothing denominator $R_i + \alpha$ | rows sum to more than 1 | `test_rows_sum_to_one` (mutant `s01`) |
| 10. multiplying by the temperature | $\tau = 0.5$ flattens instead of sharpening | `test_temperature_sharpens` (mutant `s05`) |
| 11. `np.argmax` on a reversed row, or `>=` in a manual loop | greedy ties go to the highest id, and engines disagree | `test_greedy_ties_go_to_lowest_id` (mutant `s07`) |
| 12. scoring the context token in `nll` | an NLL that does not depend on what follows | `test_hand_example_nll` (mutant `s06`) |
| 13. insertion order, zero padding, padding when already aligned, `{}` for empty metadata, `\u` escapes | bytes differ from the library's, so a strict reader or a hash check rejects the file | `test_matches_library_bytes` (mutants `s12`, `s13`, `s17`, `s18`), `test_worked_example_bytes` (mutant `s14`) |
| 14. converting a loaded tensor with `np.ascontiguousarray` | a scalar tensor (shape `[]`) comes back with shape `(1,)`: `ascontiguousarray` returns at least 1-D; use `np.asarray(x, dtype=np.float32, order="C")` (`lang.01` pitfall 6) | `test_roundtrip`, `test_load_reads_library_files` |

## 6. Where it's used next

| Direction | Module | How it uses this |
|---|---|---|
| Back | `M03.1` | its Python reference defines matrix multiplication; L0.0 uses NumPy row indexing for logits |
| Back | `lang.01` | numpy arrays, dtypes, `np.add.at`, and broadcasting (the vectorized bigram count) |
| Forward | `L10.0` | your Rust engine reads `bigram.weight` from this file (`tl_arch = bigram`, `tl_tokenizer = bytes`) and computes the same logits by indexing `bigram.weight` with token ids |
| Forward | `L0.5` | takes over `bigram.py`: trains the same table with your autograd until it reaches the count model's NLL within $10^{-3}$, and samples with your PCG32 |
| Forward | `L0.6` | takes over `safetensors.py`: every dtype, atomic checkpoints, the token-stream reader |

If you skip this module, `ss check L10.0` stops with `L10.0 needs L0.0`: build it, or rerun with `--ref-deps`.

## Going further

| Your piece | Production equivalent | What it adds | Where to look |
|---|---|---|---|
| add-alpha bigram | KenLM n-gram models | 5-gram contexts, modified Kneser-Ney smoothing, backoff, compact tries | KenLM `lm/builder/` |
| one-hot matmul for logits | embedding lookup | a row gather instead of a matmul: `ggml_get_rows` in llama.cpp, `torch.nn.Embedding` | `ggml/src/ggml.c` |
| `sample` | vLLM and SGLang samplers | top-k, top-p, min-p, penalties, batched on GPU with per-request seeds | vLLM `v1/sample/sampler.py` |
| `save_safetensors` | Hugging Face `safetensors` | every dtype, memory-mapped zero-copy loading, the Rust core your engine mirrors | `safetensors/src/tensor.rs` |
