# Part 5: The Transformer (2017)

Attention is all you need, built from its parts. Scaled dot-product attention with its backward pass, the masks (causal, padding, sliding window, additive), multi-head attention, sinusoidal and learned positions, and the full encoder-decoder transformer with both LayerNorm placements and the Noam schedule.

**Course passes**: 5 (L5.1 to L5.5, milestone MS-L5, part of gate MS-P5)

**Before you start**: the solve parts `S-M05` (logic) and `S-M08` (VJP derivations); rotations and frequency ladders from [Precalculus](../../../math/00-precalculus/); attention from [Part 4](../p04-attention-origins/).

## Key ideas

- **Scaled dot product**: $\text{softmax}(QK^{\top}/\sqrt{d_k} + M)V$, where the mask $M$ adds $-\infty$ to forbidden positions.
- **Heads** split the model dimension so each head attends with its own projections; the outputs are concatenated and projected back.
- **LayerNorm placement** decides trainability: post-LN as in 2017 needs warmup, pre-LN trains without it.

## Modules

| Module | Topic | Kind | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|
| `L5.1` | Scaled dot-product attention (forward and backward) | build | 5 |
| `L5.2` | Masks: causal, padding, sliding window, additive | build | 5 |
| `L5.3` | Multi-head attention | build | 5 |
| `L5.4` | Positional encodings: sinusoidal, learned | build | 5 |
| `L5.5` | Encoder-decoder Transformer with both LayerNorm placements (post-LN as in 2017, pre-LN as `norm='pre'`), Noam schedule, label smoothing | build | 5 |
