# Part 3: Recurrent Networks

Sequence models with state. A vanilla RNN with backpropagation through time written by hand, then the LSTM and GRU in torch's gate order (so weights load from torch checkpoints), bidirectional RNNs with length-aware reversal, and an RNN language model trained with stateful truncated BPTT. ELMo's bidirectional LM and scalar mix is optional.

**Course passes**: 4 (L3.1 to L3.6, milestone MS-L3, part of gate MS-P4)

**Before you start**: the matrix-calculus VJPs ([M08.3](../../../math/08-matrix-calculus-and-autodiff/)) and gradient clipping ([M10.4](../../../math/10-optimization/)); the autograd engine of [Part 0](../p00-foundations/).

## Key ideas

- **BPTT** is reverse mode through time: the gradient of an early state is a product of Jacobians, which vanishes or explodes; clipping and gating are the cures.
- **Gates are learned multiplexers**: the LSTM's forget gate lets gradient flow through the cell state almost unchanged.
- **Truncation is a memory budget**: stateful TBPTT carries the hidden state across batches but cuts the gradient every $k$ steps.

## Modules

| Module | Topic | Kind | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|
| `L3.1` | Vanilla RNN with **manual** BPTT and truncation | build | 4 |
| `L3.2` | LSTM (torch gate order i, f, g, o) | build | 4 |
| `L3.3` | GRU (torch gate order r, z, n) | build | 4 |
| `L3.4` | Bidirectional RNN with length-aware reversal | build | 4 |
| `L3.5` | ELMo: biLM, ScalarMix, linear probes | build | 4, optional |
| `L3.6` | RNN language model with stateful TBPTT | build | 4 |

The worked example for `L3.2` is `lstm_cell.c` from [Neural Architectures](../../06-neural-architectures/), whose RNN and LSTM sections these chapters absorb.

No chapters yet: they arrive with authoring batch B6 (course/DESIGN.md 9). `ss lint --fix-index` then fills this table from the registry.
