# Part 4: Attention Origins

Where attention came from: sequence-to-sequence translation. An encoder-decoder trained with teacher forcing, then Bahdanau's additive attention and Luong's dot, general, and concat scores with input feeding, a generic beam search over any step function, and the metrics that grade generated sequences (exact match, BLEU, chrF).

**Course passes**: 4 (L4.1 to L4.5, milestone MS-L4, part of gate MS-P4)

**Before you start**: the just-in-time math `M07.4` and the solve part `S-M07c`; the recurrent layers of [Part 3](../p03-recurrent/).

## Key ideas

- **The bottleneck**: a fixed-size encoder state cannot hold a long sentence; attention lets each decoder step read a weighted average of all encoder states.
- **Scores to weights**: a score per source position, a softmax, a weighted sum; the 2017 transformer keeps exactly this and drops the recurrence.
- **Search is separate from the model**: beam search keeps the $k$ best prefixes by summed log-probability, with length normalization.
