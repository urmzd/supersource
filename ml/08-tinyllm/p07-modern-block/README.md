# Part 7: The Modern Decoder Block

What changed between 2017 and a Llama-family model. Pre-LN with RMSNorm, gated MLPs (SwiGLU, GeGLU), rotary position embeddings and context extension (PI, NTK, YaRN, Llama-3 scaling), grouped-query and multi-head latent attention, sliding windows and attention sinks, mixture of experts, and the Llama-family model that loads Hugging Face configs and weights and matches SmolLM2-135M.

**Course passes**: 5 (L7.1 to L7.9, milestone MS-L7, part of gate MS-P5)

**Before you start**: the just-in-time math `M05.1` (parameter and FLOP counting); [Part 5](../p05-transformer-2017/) and [Part 6](../p06-objectives/); rotations from [Precalculus](../../../math/00-precalculus/).

## Key ideas

- **RoPE** rotates each pair of query and key dimensions by an angle proportional to position, so their dot product depends only on the relative offset.
- **KV bytes are the serving cost**: GQA shares key and value heads across query heads; MLA compresses them into a latent and absorbs the up-projection into the query.
- **MoE** routes each token to $k$ of $E$ experts, so parameters grow without growing per-token compute; balancing the load is the hard part.
