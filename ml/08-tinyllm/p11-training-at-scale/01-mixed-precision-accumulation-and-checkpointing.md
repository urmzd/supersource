## Key Takeaways

- Mixed precision rounds what a matmul reads and writes, and nothing else: the weights stay float32 masters, so an update smaller than bf16's spacing still lands (`test_hand_example_bf16_matmul`, `test_autocast_grads_are_bf16_and_masters_stay_fp32`, `test_train_step_mixed_bf16_tracks_fp32`).
- fp16 gradients below $2^{-24}$ flush to zero. Multiplying the loss by $S$ multiplies every gradient by $S$ (backprop is linear), which lifts them into range; dividing by $S$ before the update undoes it, and a step whose gradients overflowed is skipped and $S$ halved (`test_fp16_underflow_is_rescued_by_loss_scaling`, `test_scaler_skips_inf_steps`).
- Weighting micro-batch $i$'s mean loss by $n_i/N$ makes $k$ micro-batches give exactly the gradient of one batch of $N$ rows (`test_hand_example_accumulation`, `test_accumulation_equals_one_big_batch`).
- A checkpointed segment reruns the same operations on the same values during backward, so its gradients are equal bit for bit, provided the rerun replays the random draws and its parameters are parents of the node (`test_checkpoint_grads_bitwise_equal`, `test_checkpoint_replays_dropout_rng`).

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start L11.1              # stubs precision.py and recompute.py into your repo
ss tests L11.1              # read the test catalog first
ss check L11.1              # course tests, then your tests graded by mutation
ss mutate L11.1             # the full mutation grade of your tests
ss check L11.1 --ref-deps   # only if your M08.4, M09.1, M10.4, or L0.x is not passing
ss diff  L11.1              # after passing: your code against the reference
```

## 1. Why now

The capstone (`C1`) trains a 10.4M-parameter Llama with a 512-token context. Your `L0.5` loop runs one batch per step, all in float32, and keeps every layer's activations until `backward()` returns. Three things break at that size. The batch the recipe calls for (32 sequences) does not fit: `M05.1`'s `memory_plan` puts the float32 activations of one 512-token sequence through the 8 layers at 161 MiB, so a batch of 32 needs 5.0 GiB of activations next to 159 MiB of weights, gradients, and AdamW moments. Real hardware trains in bf16 or fp16 for speed and memory, and you need to know that the run you design here still converges when every matmul reads 8-bit mantissas, before you trust a recipe that depends on it. And when a gradient underflows or overflows in fp16, a float32 loop never sees it. This module adds the four tools every large training run uses, each behind one call: `autocast` (emulated low precision), `DynamicLossScaler` (fp16 range), `grad_accumulate` (a big batch from small ones), and `checkpoint_sequential` (activations kept on `M08.4`'s schedule). The emulation runs on numpy and is not faster; what it gives you is the exact numerics, so the convergence and memory claims of `MS-L11` are measured, not assumed.

## 2. Principles

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $\mathrm{rd}_{16}(x)$ | $x$ rounded to nearest, ties to even, into bf16 or fp16 (`M09.1`) | elementwise |
| $p$ | the precision of a format, in significant bits: 24 (fp32), 11 (fp16), 8 (bf16) | `int` |
| $u = 2^{-p}$ | the unit roundoff: the largest relative error of one rounding | float |
| $w$ | a parameter (the float32 master copy) | `float32[...]` |
| $\eta$ | the learning rate | float |
| $L$, $g = \partial L/\partial w$ | the loss and a gradient | float, like $w$ |
| $S$ | the loss scale (`loss_scale`) | float, a power of 2 |
| $N$, $n_i$, $k$ | rows in the full batch, rows in micro-batch $i$, number of micro-batches | `int` |
| $L_i$ | the mean loss over micro-batch $i$'s rows | float |
| $s_j$, $P$ | segment sizes and peak memory of a checkpoint schedule (`M08.4`) | `int` |

**Two 16-bit formats.** Both keep a sign, an exponent, and a mantissa in 16 bits. bf16 keeps float32's 8 exponent bits and 7 mantissa bits: the same range (up to about $3.4 \times 10^{38}$) with $p = 8$, so $u = 2^{-8} \approx 0.4\%$. fp16 has 5 exponent bits and 10 mantissa bits: $p = 11$, $u \approx 0.05\%$, but its largest finite value is 65504, its smallest normal $2^{-14} \approx 6.1 \times 10^{-5}$, and its smallest subnormal $2^{-24} \approx 6 \times 10^{-8}$. bf16 trades precision for range; fp16 trades range for precision. numpy has neither, so `M09.1`'s `round_to_bf16` and `round_to_fp16` emulate them: a float array whose entries are all values of the format.

**What a bf16 matmul does.** A tensor core reads two bf16 matrices, multiplies, accumulates the sums in float32, and writes a bf16 result. So $Y = AB$ becomes

$$Y = \mathrm{rd}_{16}\big(\mathrm{rd}_{16}(A)\, \mathrm{rd}_{16}(B)\big), \qquad \text{the product computed in float32}.$$

Each operand entry has relative error up to $u$, and the output one more rounding. Errors of different entries are independent-looking, so a dot product of length $K$ drifts by about $\sqrt K\, u$ relative, not $K u$; for training this is noise of a few tenths of a percent, smaller than minibatch noise.

**The cast is an op with a gradient.** Write the emulated storage as an op `cast`: forward $y = \mathrm{rd}_{16}(x)$. Its true derivative is zero almost everywhere (a step function), which would stop all learning; what hardware does is pass the gradient through the conversion, and a gradient that arrives in bf16 is a bf16 value. So the backward of a cast is the cast of the gradient: $\bar x = \mathrm{rd}_{16}(\bar y)$. Built from `from_op` (`L0.1`), the autocast matmul is `cast(cast(a) @ cast(b))`, and its backward computes $\bar A = \mathrm{rd}_{16}(\mathrm{rd}_{16}(\bar Y)\, \mathrm{rd}_{16}(B)^\top)$: a bf16 backward matmul, exactly what a GPU runs. Because every matmul in your models goes through `Tensor.__matmul__` (`F.matmul`, `Linear`, attention), `autocast` swaps in the rounding version for the length of a `with` block and puts the original back on the way out, also when the block raises. That is what `torch.autocast` does with its dispatch keys.

**Why the weights stay float32.** The update $w \leftarrow w - \eta g$ is where precision matters most. The spacing of bf16 numbers near 1 is $2^{-7} \approx 0.0078$: a weight of 1 updated by $\eta g = 10^{-3}$ rounds straight back to 1, and the update is lost. Training in pure bf16 stalls once updates become small. So the parameters, the optimizer state (AdamW's moments), and the update stay float32: the "master weights". Only the matmuls, which dominate the time and the activation memory, run on rounded operands. `M05.1`'s memory plan counts this: bf16 AdamW is 2 (weights) + 2 (grads) + 4 (master) + 8 (moments) = 16 bytes per parameter, the same as float32, and the saving is all in activations.

**Loss scaling.** In fp16 the problem is range, not precision. Gradients of a mean loss over many tokens are small: a cross-entropy gradient on the logits is $(\mathrm{softmax} - \mathrm{onehot})/N$, and backpropagated through a few layers many entries fall below $2^{-24}$ and flush to zero. Backprop is linear in the upstream gradient: every VJP is linear in $\bar y$, so starting backward from $S \cdot L$ instead of $L$ multiplies every gradient by exactly $S$. Choose $S$ so the small gradients land in fp16's normal range, and divide the float32 master gradients by $S$ before the update. With $S$ a power of two, scaling and unscaling are exact (they only change the exponent).

**Dynamic scaling.** Too large an $S$ overflows the large gradients to $\infty$ (and $\infty - \infty$ to NaN). The fix is to detect, not to predict: after backward, if any gradient is non-finite, skip the whole step (one poisoned entry would corrupt every weight it touches through the optimizer), drop the gradients, and multiply $S$ by the backoff $\tfrac12$. After `interval` consecutive good steps, multiply $S$ by the growth factor 2 to probe upward again. The count of good steps restarts after every overflow and every growth. A skipped step costs one batch; a run without scaling silently loses its small gradients. Clipping (`M10.4`) comes after unscaling, because the clip bound is a norm in true gradient units. bf16 has float32's range and needs no scaler.

**Gradient accumulation.** The loss of a batch of $N$ rows is the mean of per-row losses $\ell_r$. Split the rows into micro-batches $B_1, \dots, B_k$ with $n_i$ rows each, and let $L_i$ be micro-batch $i$'s own mean. Then

$$L = \frac1N \sum_{r} \ell_r = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{n_i}{N} \cdot \frac{1}{n_i}\sum_{r \in B_i} \ell_r = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{n_i}{N} L_i,$$

and since the gradient is linear, $\nabla L = \sum_i \tfrac{n_i}{N} \nabla L_i$. Backpropagating $\tfrac{n_i}{N} L_i$ for each micro-batch, without zeroing in between (the Tensor adds into `.grad`, `L0.1`), accumulates exactly $\nabla L$. Only one micro-batch's activations exist at a time. Weighting by $\tfrac1k$ is the same only when all micro-batches have equal size; the last one of an epoch usually does not. The results agree with one big batch to float32 rounding, not bit for bit, because the sums are added in a different order.

**Activation checkpointing.** `M08.4` counted the trade: keep only some layers' inputs and recompute the rest during backward. The mechanism is one graph node. `checkpoint(fn, x)` runs `fn` under `no_grad`, so none of its intermediate values are recorded, and returns a node (`from_op`) whose parents are $x$ and the parameters `fn` reads. When backward reaches the node, its VJP reruns `fn` with grad mode on, from fresh leaf copies of its inputs, backpropagates the upstream gradient through that rerun (which adds the parameter gradients into their `.grad` directly), and returns the inputs' gradients. `checkpoint_sequential` applies `M08.4`'s `checkpoint_schedule`: every segment but the last through `checkpoint`, the last one normally.

Three details make the gradients equal bit for bit. The rerun performs the same floating-point operations on the same values, so it produces the same activations. A dropout layer draws a new mask from its generator on every call, so the node records the generator's state before the forward pass, sets it back for the rerun, and afterwards restores the state the stream had reached, as if nothing had been rerun. And the segment's parameters must be parents of the node: the first segment's input is data, which does not require grad, and `from_op` records a node only when some parent requires grad, so without the parameters the first layers would silently get no gradient (the classic bug of reentrant checkpointing in PyTorch).

One difference from `M08.4`'s model: your `L0.1` `backward()` keeps the whole outer graph alive until it returns, where PyTorch frees each saved tensor as soon as backward has used it. So the activation memory held between forward and backward falls as `M08.4` predicts, while the peak during backward falls less, because the last segment stays alive while earlier segments are recomputed (`test_checkpoint_lowers_peak_memory` measures both).

## 3. Worked example by hand

**A bf16 matmul.** $A = [1, 1]$, $B = [1, 2^{-8}]^\top$. Both are bf16 values already. The float32 product is $1 + 2^{-8} = 1.00390625$. Its bf16 neighbours are 1 and $1 + 2^{-7}$, with $1 + 2^{-8}$ exactly halfway; ties go to the even mantissa, so autocast returns $1.0$. An input of $1.01$ is stored as $1.0078125 = 1 + 2^{-7}$, the nearest bf16 value. For $L = \sum Y$, $\bar Y = 1$ and $\bar A = \mathrm{rd}(\bar Y)\,\mathrm{rd}(B)^\top = [1, 2^{-8}]$, $\bar B = \mathrm{rd}(A)^\top \mathrm{rd}(\bar Y) = [1, 1]^\top$. The same product outside autocast is the float32 $1.00390625$.

**Accumulation.** One weight $w = 1$, inputs $x = [1, 2, 3, 4]$, targets $2x$, loss the mean of $(wx - 2x)^2$. With $w = 1$ the residuals are $-x$:

| | rows | $L_i$ | $\partial L_i/\partial w = \mathrm{mean}(2(wx - 2x)x)$ | weight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| one batch | 1, 2, 3, 4 | $(1 + 4 + 9 + 16)/4 = 7.5$ | $2(-1 - 4 - 9 - 16)/4 = -15$ | 1 |
| micro-batch 1 | 1 | 1 | $-2$ | $1/4$ |
| micro-batch 2 | 2, 3, 4 | $29/3$ | $2(-4 - 9 - 16)/3 = -58/3$ | $3/4$ |

Weighted: $\tfrac14(-2) + \tfrac34(-\tfrac{58}{3}) = -0.5 - 14.5 = -15$, and the loss $\tfrac14 \cdot 1 + \tfrac34 \cdot \tfrac{29}{3} = 7.5$. Weighting each by $\tfrac12$ gives $-10.67$; not weighting at all gives $-21.3$.

**Loss scaling.** $S = 8$, growth 2, backoff $\tfrac12$, interval 2, SGD with $\eta = 0.5$ on one parameter starting at 0. The scaled gradients arrive as below:

| step | scaled $g$ | finite? | unscaled $g/S$ | $w$ after | $S$ after | good steps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 8 | yes | 1 | $-0.5$ | 8 | 1 |
| 2 | $\infty$ | no: skip | | $-0.5$ | 4 | 0 |
| 3 | 4 | yes | 1 | $-1.0$ | 4 | 1 |
| 4 | 8 | yes | 2 | $-2.0$ | 8 (grown) | 0 |
| 5 | 16 | yes | 2 | $-3.0$ | 8 | 1 |

If the count did not restart at the overflow, step 3 would already be the second good step and grow $S$ one step early.

**Checkpointing six layers.** With a budget of 4 units, `checkpoint_schedule(6, 4) == [0, 3]` (`M08.4`, section 3). The forward pass runs layers 0 to 2 under `no_grad` and keeps only their input, then layers 3 to 5 normally. Backward runs layers 5, 4, 3, reaches the checkpoint node, reruns layers 0 to 2 forward, and backpropagates through them. Each of layers 0 to 2 has run forward twice, layers 3 to 5 once, and every gradient equals the plain run's. These four examples are the first four tests in section 4.

## 4. The interface

```python
# python/tinyllm/train/precision.py
def cast(x: Tensor, dtype: Literal["bf16", "fp16"]) -> Tensor        # rounds forward and backward
@contextmanager
def autocast(dtype) -> Iterator[None]                                 # every Tensor matmul: cast(cast(a) @ cast(b))
def autocast_bf16(); def autocast_dtype() -> Optional[str]
class DynamicLossScaler:
    def __init__(self, init=2.0**16, growth=2.0, backoff=0.5, interval=2000)
    def scale(self, loss: Tensor) -> Tensor                           # loss * S
    def step(self, opt, params, clip=None) -> bool                    # check, unscale, clip, step, update S
    def state_dict(self) -> dict; def load_state_dict(self, sd) -> None
def grad_accumulate(model, micro_batches, loss_fn, scaler=None) -> float          # weights n_i / N
def train_step_mixed(model, micro_batches, loss_fn, opt, precision="fp32", scaler=None, clip=None) -> dict

# python/tinyllm/train/recompute.py
def checkpoint(fn, *args, params=(), rngs=()) -> Tensor
def checkpoint_sequential(layers, x, mem_budget_layers, rngs=()) -> Tensor        # M08.4's schedule
```

`train_step_mixed` is `L0.5`'s `train_step` for the capstone: zero the gradients, accumulate the micro-batches under `autocast(precision)` (none for `"fp32"`), then either the scaler's step or a finite-loss check, clipping, and `opt.step()`. It returns `{"loss", "skipped", "scale"}` plus `"grad_norm"` when it clipped. `autocast` patches `Tensor.__matmul__` and `__rmatmul__` process-wide while the outermost block is open; blocks nest and the innermost dtype applies.

## 5. Pitfalls

| 4. a cast that changes float64 to float32 | dtype mixing downstream | `test_cast_rounds_both_directions` (mutant `s04`) |
| 5. no `try`/`finally` around the patched matmul | an exception leaves every later matmul in bf16 | `test_autocast_restores_matmul` (mutant `s05`) |
| 6. leaving an inner block ends the outer one | the rest of the outer block runs in float32 | `test_autocast_restores_matmul` (mutant `s06`) |
| 7. weighting micro-batches $1/k$ | wrong gradient whenever the sizes differ | `test_hand_example_accumulation` (mutant `s07`) |
| 8. summing micro-batch losses | gradients $k$ times too large | `test_accumulation_equals_one_big_batch` (mutant `s08`) |

| 10. reporting the unweighted mean loss | the logged loss disagrees with the gradient's | `test_hand_example_accumulation` (mutant `s10`) |
| 11. never unscaling | the update is $S$ times too large | `test_hand_example_loss_scaler` (mutant `s11`) |
| 12. stepping on non-finite gradients | one overflow makes every weight NaN | `test_scaler_skips_inf_steps` (mutant `s12`) |
| 13. keeping the bad gradients after a skip | a loop without `zero_grad` adds onto $\infty$ | `test_scaler_skips_inf_steps` (mutant `s13`) |
| 14. not restarting the count after an overflow | $S$ grows right back into overflow | `test_hand_example_loss_scaler` (mutant `s14`) |
| 15. clipping before unscaling | the clip acts on $S \cdot g$: tiny updates | `test_scaler_unscales_before_clipping` (mutant `s15`) |
| 16. losing the count on resume | the resumed run grows $S$ late | `test_scaler_state_dict_roundtrip` (mutant `s16`) |
| 17. stepping on a NaN loss without a scaler | the run is poisoned silently | `test_train_step_mixed_rejects_nan_loss` (mutant `s17`) |
| 18. checkpointing the last segment too | every layer runs twice for nothing | `test_hand_example_checkpoint_schedule` (mutant `s18`) |
| 19. parameters not parents of the node | the first segment stops learning on data input | `test_checkpoint_params_get_grads_from_data_input` (mutant `s19`) |
| 20. a tensor passed twice gets its gradient twice | doubled gradients for shared inputs | `test_checkpoint_function_and_no_grad` (mutant `s20`) |
| 21. not replaying the generator | the rerun's dropout mask differs from the forward pass's | `test_checkpoint_replays_dropout_rng` (mutant `s21`) |
| 22. not restoring the generator after the rerun | later draws repeat; runs with and without checkpointing diverge | `test_checkpoint_replays_dropout_rng` (mutant `s22`) |
| 23. running the forward pass with the graph on | correct gradients, no memory saved | `test_checkpoint_lowers_peak_memory` (mutant `s23`) |
| 24. rerunning on the original tensors | the rerun's backward runs into the outer graph | `test_checkpoint_grads_bitwise_equal` (mutant `s24`) |

## 6. Where it's used next

| Direction | Module | How it uses this |
|---|---|---|
| Back | `L0.1` | `from_op` builds `cast` and the checkpoint node; grad mode decides what the forward pass records |
| Back | `L0.3` | `mse` is the tests' loss |
| Back | `L0.4` | `Module.parameters()` lists a segment's parents; the tests' layers |
| Back | `M09.1` | `round_to_bf16` and `round_to_fp16` are the emulated formats |
| Back | `M10.2` | `SGD` in the tests |
| Back | `M10.3` | `AdamW` in the tests and the capstone |
| Back | `M10.4` | `clip_grad_norm_` after unscaling |
| Back | `M08.4` | `checkpoint_schedule` plans the segments |
| Forward | `C1` | the capstone trainer: bf16, accumulation of 4 micro-batches of 8, checkpointed blocks; `MS-L11` compares it with a float32 run |

If you skip this module, the capstone's `--bf16 --accum --checkpoint-activations` flags have nothing to call.

## Going further

| Your piece | Production equivalent | What it adds | Where to look |
