# Part 11: Training at Scale

What it takes to train the capstone on a laptop, and what changes on a cluster. The core module adds bf16 mixed precision (emulated), fp16 loss scaling, gradient accumulation, and activation checkpointing. Collectives (ring all-reduce over shared memory) and data parallelism with ZeRO stages are optional, with tensor and pipeline parallelism as side quests.

**Course passes**: 9 (L11.1, milestone MS-L11, part of gate MS-P9); L11.2 and L11.3 optional

**Before you start**: the just-in-time math `M08.4` (Hessian-vector products and checkpoint schedules); bf16 emulation from [Numerical Methods and Floating Point](../../../math/09-numerical-methods-and-floating-point/); the optimizers of [Optimization](../../../math/10-optimization/).

## Key ideas

- **Mixed precision** keeps a float32 master copy of the weights and computes in bf16; fp16 needs a loss scale so small gradients do not underflow.
- **Accumulation** sums gradients over micro-batches so a large effective batch fits in memory, with the loss scaled by the number of micro-batches.
- **Checkpointing** stores activations at segment boundaries and recomputes the rest during backward, trading compute for memory.

## Modules

| Module | Topic | Kind | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|

| `L11.2` | Collectives over processes (ring all-reduce over shared memory) | build | 9, optional |
| `L11.3` | DDP and ZeRO-1/2/3 | build | 9, optional |
