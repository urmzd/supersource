## Key Takeaways

- The Rust engine owns the model graph and calls one C kernel per operation; every safe wrapper checks every slice length before a pointer reaches C, and every C status comes back as a `TlError` with `tl_last_error()` (`wrappers_check_lengths_before_c`, `kv_pool_wrappers_map_c_errors`).
- `KvPool` owns one `tl_kv_pool`, and its `Drop` destroys it exactly once: every allocation the C side made through the allocator hook is freed (`kv_pool_drop_frees_exactly_once`).
- One step runs a batch of sequences, each a run of new tokens at absolute positions; their K and V go into the pool as f16 and are read back for attention, so the logits match Hugging Face's float32 forward within the f16 bound (`tiny_llama_logits_match_hf`).
- The kernels are batch- and chunk-invariant, so batching sequences together or splitting a prompt into steps changes nothing, bit for bit (`batched_forward_equals_single`, `incremental_decode_equals_full_prefill`).
- The sampler follows spec/sampling.md step by step in f64, so the same logits and seed give your Python's id and logprob exactly (`sampler_matches_l81_golden`, `hand_example_sampling`).

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start L10.1               # stubs tl-sys kernels.rs and kv.rs, and tl-engine quant, model, forward, runner, sample
ss tests L10.1               # read the test catalog first: rung R0, you write no graded tests here
ss check L10.1               # exit code is the verdict
ss check L10.1 --ref-deps    # only if a C kernel or rt.04 is not passing yet
ss parity sampler rng        # your Rust sampler and PCG32 against your Python, through the golden files
```

`ss start` never rewrites your files, so two crate roots get a few lines from you: in `tl-sys/src/lib.rs` (yours since `L10.0`, whose functions keep their signatures) add `pub mod kernels; pub mod kv;` and `pub use kernels::*; pub use kv::*;`, and in `tl-engine/src/lib.rs` (yours since `L8.4`) one `pub mod` line per new file. Add the dependencies the course's `tl-engine/Cargo.toml` lists to yours: `tl-sys` by path, `anyhow`, `memmap2`, `serde_json` (`contracts/allowed-deps.toml`).

---

## 1. Why now

Your tracer engine (`L10.0`) serves one model, a byte bigram, with one request per thread and a sampler that is not the one your Python uses. Pass 7 turns it into a real inference engine, and everything after it in this part (scheduling, chunked prefill, prefix caching, the OpenAI server) needs one thing first: a component that loads a Llama checkpoint, runs a batch of sequences through it with your C kernels, keeps each sequence's past in the KV pool, and turns logits into tokens exactly as your Python does. That component is the model runner. Rust owns the graph (decision D7); C owns the arithmetic (Part 9); this module is the bridge.

## 2. Principles

### 2.1 Three layers in one engine

```text
tl-engine runner.rs    ModelRunner::forward(&ForwardBatch) -> Logits
          forward.rs   llama_forward: embedding, per layer [norm, q k v, rope, write KV, attention, o, norm, swiglu], norm, LM head
          model.rs     config.json, model.safetensors (mmap), Weights
          quant.rs     f16 / bf16 / int4 numbers
          sample.rs    Pcg32, SamplingParams, sample()
tl-sys    lib.rs       extern "C" declarations, safe wrappers, KvPool (RAII)
libtinyllm (C)         tl_matmul_f32, tl_flash_attn_fwd_f32, tl_matmul_q4_f32, tl_rmsnorm_f32, ..., tl_kv_*
```

### 2.2 `tl-sys`: binding C safely

Your `L10.0` crate root bound three functions; `kernels.rs` and `kv.rs` bind the rest, and the crate root re-exports them, so `tl_sys::KvPool` and `tl_sys::kernels::KvPool` name the same type. A binding has three layers. **Declarations** copy each C prototype with the exact types: `int64_t` is `i64`, `int` is `c_int`, `size_t` is `usize`, and `tl_status` and `tl_dtype` are `i32` constants, never Rust enums, because a C value outside the enum would be undefined behavior in Rust (`c/ABI.md` rule 5). Structs that cross the boundary (`tl_kv_cfg`, `tl_kv_stats`, `tl_allocator`) are `#[repr(C)]` with the field order and sizes of the header.

**Safe functions** check what C will not: each slice holds at least the elements the dimensions reach (for a row-major matrix of $r$ rows, $c$ columns, and leading dimension $\ell$: $(r - 1)\,\ell + c$), every embedding id is below the table's row count, and a dimension fits in `int64_t`. Only then is a pointer passed. A non-zero status becomes `Err(TlError { status, name, message })`, with `message` read from the thread's error slot **immediately**. Functions that return `void` report misuse only through the error slot, so `KvPool::retain` clears the slot (`tl_set_last_error(NULL)`), calls `tl_kv_ref`, and reads the slot back.

**RAII owners** tie a C object's lifetime to a Rust value. `KvPool` holds a `NonNull<RawKvPool>`; `KvPool::new` is the only way to get one, and `impl Drop for KvPool` calls `tl_kv_pool_destroy` once. Safe code cannot copy a `KvPool` (it is not `Clone`), and a moved-from value is never dropped, so destroy runs exactly once. The pool is not thread-safe (`kv_pool.h`): `KvPool` is `Send` (it may move to another thread) but not `Sync` (it may not be shared), so the runner and the block manager share it as `Arc<Mutex<KvPool>>` (`SharedPool`).

The allocator hook makes the "exactly once" testable: `tl_set_allocator` installs a pair of functions every C allocation goes through, so a test counts allocations and frees, and makes the hook fail to check that a failed constructor frees what it took.

### 2.3 The model directory

`config.json` says what to build (`tl_arch`: `bigram` or `llama`; `tl_tokenizer`; the shape fields of Hugging Face's Llama config). Anything this engine cannot run correctly, a scaled RoPE (`rope_type` other than `default`), a sliding window, attention biases, is refused at load with a message, never served wrong.

`model.safetensors` is read through a **memory map** (`memmap2`): the operating system maps the file into the address space and pages bytes in on first touch, so a 270 MB checkpoint is not copied before the first request. The header rules are those of `L10.0`: a u64 little-endian header length $N$, $N$ bytes of JSON, then the data buffer, with every `data_offsets` range counted from the start of the **data buffer** and the ranges tiling it exactly.

Weights arrive as F32, F16, or BF16 and are widened to f32 at load:

$$\text{bf16}(h) = \text{f32 with bits } h \ll 16, \qquad \text{f16}(h) = (-1)^{s}\, 2^{e - 15}\,\big(1 + \tfrac{m}{1024}\big) \text{ for } 0 < e < 31,$$

with subnormals $(-1)^s\, 2^{-14}\, \tfrac{m}{1024}$ for $e = 0$. The reverse direction (f32 to f16, for the KV cache) **rounds to nearest, ties to even**: keep the top 10 mantissa bits, and add one when the dropped bits are above half, or exactly half with the kept value odd.

### 2.4 The Llama forward, one step

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $S$ | sequences in the step | integer |
| $n_s$, $p_s$ | new tokens of sequence $s$ and the absolute position of its first one | integers |
| $N = \sum_s n_s$ | tokens in the step | integer |
| $d$ | hidden size (`hidden_size`) | integer |
| $H$, $H_{kv}$, $D$ | query heads, key/value heads, head size | integers |
| $x \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$ | hidden states of every new token, in batch order | `f32` |
| $W_q, W_k, W_v, W_o$ | attention projections, stored `[out, in]` | `f32` or int4 |
| $\mathrm{pos}(t)$ | absolute position of token $t$: $p_s + i$ for the $i$-th new token of $s$ | `i32` |
| $\epsilon$ | `rms_norm_eps` | `f32` |
| $B$ | token positions per KV block (`block_size`) | integer |

Each step computes, for every layer:

$$h = \mathrm{RMSNorm}(x) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{\tfrac{1}{d}\sum_i x_i^2 + \epsilon}} \odot w, \qquad q = h W_q^\top,\; k = h W_k^\top,\; v = h W_v^\top$$

then rotates $q$ and $k$ by RoPE at $\mathrm{pos}(t)$ (`tl_rope_f32`, half layout), writes each token's $k$ and $v$ into its sequence's blocks (position $j$ lives in block $\lfloor j / B \rfloor$ of the block table, slot $j \bmod B$), and for each sequence gathers its keys and values for positions $0$ to $p_s + n_s - 1$ and runs FlashAttention with `q_offset` $= p_s$ and a causal mask:

$$o_t = \sum_{j \le \mathrm{pos}(t)} \mathrm{softmax}_j\!\Big(\tfrac{q_t \cdot k_j}{\sqrt{D}}\Big)\, v_j, \qquad x \mathrel{+}= o W_o^\top, \qquad x \mathrel{+}= \big(\mathrm{silu}(h_2 W_g^\top) \odot (h_2 W_u^\top)\big) W_d^\top$$

with $h_2 = \mathrm{RMSNorm}(x)$ before the MLP. After the last layer, only each sequence's **last** token goes through the final norm and the LM head (the embedding matrix itself when `tie_word_embeddings` is true), giving one row of logits per sequence.

Two properties carry the rest of this part. **Batch invariance**: the projections run once over all $N$ tokens, and because the matmul reduces each output in one fixed order whatever $M$ is (`c/ABI.md` rule 10), a sequence's rows are the same alone or batched. **Chunk invariance**: positions are absolute, the cache holds the same f16 keys either way, and the attention kernel reduces keys in tiles aligned to absolute positions, so prefilling a prompt in one step or in pieces gives the same logits, bit for bit.

**The f16 bound.** K and V pass through f16, which rounds with relative error at most $2^{-11} \approx 4.9 \times 10^{-4}$. Through two layers this perturbs the logits of the tiny test model (magnitudes up to about 20) by about $7 \times 10^{-3}$, measured; the tests allow $10^{-3}$ of the largest logit, $2 \times 10^{-2}$. Your Python reference (`L7.9`) keeps f32 keys, so this bound, not 1e-4, is what an f16 cache can promise.

### 2.5 Int4 weights

A quantized linear weight $W \in \mathbb{R}^{\text{out} \times \text{in}}$ with groups of $g$ columns stores, per group, one f16 scale and $g$ four-bit integers (`L8.5`, `formats/safetensors.md`):

$$s = \mathrm{f16}\Big(\frac{\max |W_{\text{group}}|}{7}\Big), \qquad q = \mathrm{clamp}\big(\mathrm{rint}(W / s), -8, 7\big), \qquad \hat W = q\, s$$

with `rint` rounding half to even and $s$ the f16 value **actually stored**, so $|W - \hat W| \le s/2$. Two values share a byte: column $2b$ in the low nibble, $2b + 1$ in the high nibble, each in 4-bit two's complement. `QLinear::forward` hands the packed bytes and scales to `tl_matmul_q4_f32`, which never widens $W$ to f32 in memory. The runner loads int4 two ways: from an int4 file (`<name>.qweight`, `<name>.scales`, metadata `quant = "int4-g<g>-sym"`), or by quantizing f32 weights at load (`EngineConfig.quant = Some(Quant::Int4 { group })`).

### 2.6 The sampler and PCG32

`sample.rs` ports your `L8.1` sampler and `M06.3` generator, and **parity** means bit-identical: the same token id and the same f64 logprob from the same logits and seed. spec/sampling.md fixes the order: widen to f64; repetition penalty over the distinct ids of prompt and output ($\ell \mathrel{/}= r$ when positive, $\ell \mathrel{*}= r$ otherwise); presence and frequency over the output only ($\ell \mathrel{-}= a_f c + a_p$); the **logprob** is $\log\mathrm{softmax}(\ell)$ at this point; greedy ($T = 0$) takes the argmax with ties to the lowest id and **no draw**; otherwise divide by $T$, keep the top $k$ by $(\ell \text{ desc}, \text{id asc})$, keep the nucleus up to and including the token that reaches $p$, keep ids with $q_i \ge m \cdot \max q$, softmax over the kept ids in ascending id order, draw one $u$, and walk the cumulative sum in ascending id order to the first id with $u < c$. Every sum is a left-to-right loop, so Rust and Python add the same numbers in the same order.

Each request gets its own generator, `stream(seed, sample)`: $\mathrm{child\_seed}(s, 4) = \mathrm{mix64}(s + 4 \cdot \texttt{0x9E3779B97F4A7C15})$, then `pcg32_srandom_r(child_seed, 4)`. One uniform takes two outputs $a, b$: $u = \big((a \gg 5)\, 2^{26} + (b \gg 6)\big)\, 2^{-53}$.

## 3. Worked example by hand

**One sampled token** (spec/sampling.md, `hand_example_sampling`). Logits $x = [1, 3, 2, 3, -1]$, no history, $T = 1$, top-k 3, top-p 0.8, seed 0. Logprobs first: $M = 3$, $Z = e^{-2} + 1 + e^{-1} + 1 + e^{-4} = 2.52153$, so ids 1 and 3 have logprob $-\ln Z = -0.92487$. Top-k: order by (logit desc, id asc) is $1, 3, 2, 0, 4$; keep $\{1, 3, 2\}$. Top-p over the kept: $Z' = 1 + e^{-1} + 1 = 2.36788$, $q_1 = q_3 = 0.42232$, $q_2 = 0.15536$; walking $1, 3$: $0.42232$, then $0.84464 \ge 0.8$, so keep $\{1, 3\}$ and renormalize to $0.5, 0.5$. The generator: $\mathrm{child\_seed}(0, 4) = \texttt{0xF88BB8A8724C81EC}$, and the first uniform of `stream(0, sample)` is $u = 0.80209$. Walk ids in ascending order: after id 1, $c = 0.5$, not above $u$; after id 3, $c = 1.0 > u$: the token is **id 3**, logprob $-0.92487$.

**Int4** (`int4_hand_example`). Weights $[0.7, -1.4, 0, 0.29995]$ in one group of 4: $\max|W| = 1.4$, $1.4 / 7 = 0.2$, and $\mathrm{f16}(0.2) = 0.199951171875$ (0.2 is not a binary fraction; f16 keeps 10 mantissa bits). Dividing by the stored scale: $0.7 / 0.19995 = 3.5009 \to 4$, $-1.4 / 0.19995 = -7.0017 \to -7$, $0 \to 0$, $0.29995 / 0.19995 = 1.5001 \to 2$. With the unrounded $0.2$ the last would be $1.49975 \to 1$: the stored scale changes a value. Packing $q = [-8, 7, 1, -1]$: $-8$ is $1000_2$ and $7$ is $0111_2$, so byte 0 is $0111\,1000_2 = \texttt{0x78}$; $1 = 0001_2$ and $-1 = 1111_2$ give $1111\,0001_2 = \texttt{0xF1}$.

**f16 rounding** (`f16_rounds_to_nearest_even`). $1 + 2^{-11}$ lies exactly halfway between $1$ (`0x3C00`) and $1 + 2^{-10}$ (`0x3C01`); ties go to the even mantissa, so the result is `0x3C00`. $1 + 3 \cdot 2^{-11}$ lies halfway between `0x3C01` and `0x3C02`: the even one is `0x3C02`.

**Where a key lands.** Blocks of $B = 16$, a sequence with block table $[7, 2, 9]$: position 37 is block $\lfloor 37 / 16 \rfloor = 2$ of the table, pool block 9, slot $37 \bmod 16 = 5$. Its K for KV head $h$ starts at element $(h \cdot 16 + 5) \cdot D$ of layer $l$'s K slab of block 9.

`forward` writes K and V for the new tokens of each sequence into the blocks its table names; the caller allocates the blocks (`L10.2` and `L10.4` do from here on). `run_once` takes temporary blocks and gives them back, for embeddings and tests.

### What the tests check

| Test | KIND | Checks | Why it matters downstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hand_example_sampling` | unit | section 3: top-k 3 and top-p 0.8 keep ids 1 and 3, $u = 0.80209$, token 3 with logprob $-0.92487$ | the spec's worked example, end to end |
| `pcg32_reference_vectors` | golden | `pcg32(42)` demo line, `uniform_f64`, `child_seed`, `stream` outputs from `pcg32.vectors.json` | one generator in every language (D10) |
| `sampler_matches_l81_golden` | differential, golden | 12 cases x 12 tokens: ids and f64 logprobs bit for bit against L8.1's golden | `ss parity sampler`; the engine's seeded streams equal your Python's |
| `greedy_takes_no_draw_and_sampling_takes_one` | property | greedy leaves the generator untouched; a sampled token takes one `uniform_f64` | draw accounting for the disaggregated hand-off (L10.6) |
| `top_p_keeps_the_crossing_token` | boundary | mass exactly at $p$ keeps the crossing id | nucleus edge, the most common sampler bug |
| `penalties_follow_hf_and_openai_semantics` | unit | repetition divides positives and multiplies negatives over prompt and output; presence and frequency over output only | the OpenAI request fields mean what clients expect |
| `seeded_sampling_matches_the_distribution` | statistical | 4000 draws fit 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 (chi-square below 16.27); a seed repeats | the sampler draws from the right distribution |
| `abi_version_check` | conformance | `tl_abi_version()` is 1 and `check_abi` accepts it | the runner refuses a mismatched library |
| `kv_pool_drop_frees_exactly_once` | unit, fault | counted allocations equal frees after `Drop`; a failing hook gives `TL_ENOMEM` and leaks nothing | the engine runs for weeks |
| `kv_pool_wrappers_map_c_errors` | boundary | `TL_EFULL` all or nothing, double release `TL_EINVAL`, `retain` of a free block, slab range checks, register and lookup | the block manager relies on every one |
| `wrappers_check_lengths_before_c` | boundary | short slices and out-of-range ids are `Err` before any C call | memory safety at the FFI boundary |
| `f16_rounds_to_nearest_even` | boundary | ties, overflow, subnormals, NaN; every f16 pattern round-trips | the KV cache stores f16 |
| `int4_hand_example` | unit | section 3: nibble order and the stored-scale rule | int4 files written by your Python load here |
| `q4_linear_matches_its_dequantized_weights` | differential | the C int4 product equals x times the dequantized weights | the packed layout means what the format says |
| `safetensors_reader_rules` | boundary | offsets from the data buffer, F16 and BF16 widening, gaps and trailing bytes refused | every checkpoint goes through this reader |
| `config_refuses_what_the_engine_cannot_run` | boundary | scaled RoPE, sliding window, unknown arch, missing tokenizer refused at load | wrong models fail loudly at start |
| `bigram_checkpoint_still_serves` | conformance | the tracer checkpoint loads and greedy continues `bcd` | the Pass 1 smoke stays green (D32) |
| `tiny_llama_logits_match_hf` | golden | last-token logits within $2 \times 10^{-2}$ of HF's float32 forward | the whole graph: GQA, tied embeddings, BF16 file |
| `tiny_llama_greedy_matches_hf` | golden | 32 greedy tokens per prompt equal HF's under the near-tie rule | what MS-L10 compares with your Python |
| `incremental_decode_equals_full_prefill` | differential | prefill then one token per step equals one prefill, bit for bit | chunked prefill and preemption by recompute |
| `batched_forward_equals_single` | differential | two sequences in one step get their alone logits exactly | continuous batching changes nothing |
| `run_once_returns_its_blocks` | unit | five one-off forwards leave every block free | embeddings do not leak KV |
| `int4_runner_matches_its_dequantized_model` | differential | quantize-at-load equals an int4 file bit for bit and its dequantized f32 twin closely | both int4 paths agree |
| `forward_refuses_bad_batches` | boundary | a short block table or a position past the context is `Err` | the scheduler's mistakes surface, not corrupt KV |

## 5. Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Caught by |
|---|---|---|
| Swapping the shifts of the two draws in `uniform_f64` | uniforms that look fine and match nothing | `pcg32_reference_vectors` (mutant `s01`) |
| Seeding the sample stream on sequence 54 instead of the purpose id | every seeded stream differs from Python's | `hand_example_sampling` (mutant `s02`) |
| Taking the logprob after temperature | logprobs change with $T$; OpenAI clients get wrong values | `sampler_matches_l81_golden` (mutant `s03`) |
| `>` instead of `>=` in the nucleus walk | the token that reaches $p$ is dropped | `top_p_keeps_the_crossing_token` (mutant `s04`) |
| Walking the CDF in probability order | correct distribution, different ids for the same seed | `sampler_matches_l81_golden` (mutant `s05`) |
| Presence and frequency penalties over the prompt | prompt words become unlikely in the answer | `penalties_follow_hf_and_openai_semantics` (mutant `s06`) |
| Dividing negative logits by the repetition penalty | repeated unlikely tokens become MORE likely | `penalties_follow_hf_and_openai_semantics` (mutant `s07`) |
| Truncating instead of rounding to f16 | a drift of half an ulp per cached value | `f16_rounds_to_nearest_even` (mutant `s08`) |
| The odd column in the low nibble | int4 files from your Python decode to noise | `int4_hand_example` (mutant `s09`) |
| Rounding int4 with the f32 scale, storing the f16 one | some weights off by one level | `int4_hand_example` (mutant `s10`) |
| `data_offsets` from the start of the file | garbage weights | `safetensors_reader_rules` (mutant `s11`) |
| Reading BF16 as F16 | SmolLM2 weights come out wildly wrong | `safetensors_reader_rules` (mutant `s12`) |
| RoPE positions relative to the step | decode tokens all at position 0; output degrades after the prompt | `incremental_decode_equals_full_prefill` (mutant `s13`) |
| `q_offset` 0 for a decode step | the new token sees only key 0 | `incremental_decode_equals_full_prefill` (mutant `s14`) |
| K written to the V slab | logits far from HF | `tiny_llama_logits_match_hf` (mutant `s15`) |
| Skipping the final norm | logits scaled wrong | `tiny_llama_logits_match_hf` (mutant `s16`) |
| Not giving temporary blocks back | the pool drains a little per embedding call | `run_once_returns_its_blocks` (mutant `s17`) |
| No `Drop` for the pool | every engine restart in a test leaks the pool | `kv_pool_drop_frees_exactly_once` (mutant `s18`) |
| Ignoring a constructor's status | out of memory looks like a bad argument | `kv_pool_drop_frees_exactly_once` (mutant `s19`) |
| Swapping the two RoPE layout codes | Llama rotates the wrong pairs: logits far from HF | `tiny_llama_logits_match_hf` (mutant `s20`) |
| Skipping the ABI check at load | a stale `libtinyllm` serves garbage | `abi_version_check` |
| Checking ids only against 0 | an id past the table reads foreign memory in C | `wrappers_check_lengths_before_c` (mutant `s21`) |
| `silu` applied to the up projection | close-looking, wrong logits | `tiny_llama_logits_match_hf` (mutant `s22`) |

## 6. Where it's used next
| Forward | `L10.6` | Registered call site uses this module. |
| Forward | `L10.8` | Registered call site uses this module. |
| Forward | `L10.9` | Registered call site uses this module. |

| Direction | Module | How it uses this |
|---|---|---|
| Back | `L10.0` | tl-sys v0: `TlError`, `last_error`, `check_abi`, `matmul_f32`; the crate root that declares `kernels` and `kv` |
| Back | `rt.01` | `tl_abi_version`, the error slot behind every `TlError`, the allocator hook |
| Back | `L9.1` | `tl_matmul_f32`: every f32 projection and the LM head |
| Back | `L9.3` | `tl_flash_attn_fwd_f32` with `q_offset`: prefill, chunks, and decode |
| Back | `L9.5` | `tl_matmul_q4_f32`: int4 projections |
| Back | `L9.6` | RMSNorm, RoPE, SwiGLU, embedding, residual add |
| Back | `rt.04` | the KV pool: allocation, refcounts, slabs, hashes |
| Back | `L8.1`, `M06.3` | the sampler and generator this one reproduces bit for bit |
| Back | `L7.9` | the Llama graph this one reproduces |
| Forward | `L10.2` | the scheduler forms each step's `ForwardBatch` |
| Forward | `L10.3` | chunked prefill relies on chunk invariance |
| Forward | `L10.4` | the block manager owns the pool's blocks; this runner writes into them |
| Forward | `L10.5` | the engine loop samples with `sample` and a per-request `stream(seed, sample)` |

If you skip this module, the engine has no model to run past the tracer bigram.
