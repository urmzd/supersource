# Fused int4 and int8 dequantize-matmul in C

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Module** | `L9.5` · build · C · Pass 6 · 4 to 5 h |
| **You build** | `c/src/kernels/qmatmul.c`: `tl_matmul_q4_f32` (W4A32: signed 4-bit weights, one f16 scale per group) and `tl_matmul_q8_f32` (W8A32: int8 weights, one f32 scale per output row), each computing $y = x W^\top$ without ever writing $W$ out in float32 |
| **Contract** | [`course/contracts/c/include/tinyllm/qmatmul.h`](../../../course/contracts/c/include/tinyllm/qmatmul.h) · byte layout: [`formats/safetensors.md`](../../../course/contracts/formats/safetensors.md) (Int4 weights) · rules: [`c/ABI.md`](../../../course/contracts/c/ABI.md) |
| **Tests** | `course/tests/L9.5/`: `test_qmatmul.c` (C, under ASan and UBSan, against dequantize-then-`tl_matmul_f32`) and `test_qmatmul_ctypes.py` (Python, through your `rt.01` loader, against numpy and your `L8.5` quantizer) (what they check: section 4). Bench: `course/tests/L9.5/bench/q4_gemv_2048.c` |
| **Needs** | `rt.01` the loader · `rt.03` the pool · `M09.4` `tl_f16_to_f32` · `L9.1` your float32 matmul, the baseline · `L8.5` your Python quantizer (or `--ref-deps`). Reading: `M09.3` (error bounds) |
| **Used by** | `L10.1` (Pass 7): the Rust runner serves `*.q4.safetensors` models through this kernel |
| **Milestone** | `MS-L9` |
| **Optional depth** | Frantar et al., "GPTQ" (2022); Lin et al., "AWQ" (2023); Dettmers et al., "LLM.int8()" (2022); the llama.cpp `Q4_0` block format (`ggml-quants.c`) |

## Key Takeaways

- **Decode is memory-bound,** so reading 4.5 bits per weight instead of 32 makes it faster even though every weight must be unpacked first: the reference int4 GEMV is about 3.9 times faster than your float32 kernel at $N = K = 2048$ (`ss bench L9.5`).
- **The layout is a contract:** byte $b$ of row $n$ holds column $2b$ in the low nibble and $2b + 1$ in the high nibble, each a signed 4-bit two's complement value in $[-8, 7]$ (`every_nibble_code`, `hand_example`).
- **One scale per group of columns**, an IEEE half-precision bit pattern, multiplies the group's partial sum once: $y = \sum_g s_g \sum_{k \in g} x_k q_k$ (`matches_dequantize_then_matmul`, `f16_scales_decode_exactly`).
- **Fused means the float32 weight never exists:** each chunk of 64 weights is unpacked into a small buffer and consumed immediately.
- **Speed comes from independent accumulators the compiler can keep in registers.** Eight interleaved lanes per group, combined in a fixed tree, keep the kernel fast and every row's bits independent of the batch (`batch_invariant_rows`).

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start L9.5              # stubs c/src/kernels/qmatmul.c into your repo
ss tests L9.5              # read the test catalog first
ss check L9.5              # exit code is the verdict
ss check L9.5 --ref-deps   # only if rt.01, rt.03, M09.4, L9.1, or L8.5 is not passing yet
ss bench L9.5 --assert     # at least 2x your float32 kernel on one decode step (local only)
ss parity quant.int4       # your L8.5 encoder and this decoder against one golden
ss diff  L9.5              # after passing: your code against the reference
```

## 1. Why now

`L8.5` taught your Python stack to quantize a Llama: `quantize_int4_group` packs every projection into 4-bit codes with float16 scales, and `export_q4` writes them as `*.qweight` and `*.scales` tensors. But nothing consumes that format at speed. In Python, `QuantLinear` dequantizes back to float32 and calls numpy, so it saves disk, not time. Generating one token reads every weight of the model once; for SmolLM2-135M that is about 540 MB in float32 and about 75 MB in int4. At a laptop's 50 to 100 GB/s, the float32 read alone caps decode at roughly 100 to 200 tokens per second, and int4 raises that cap by seven. This module writes the kernel that reads the packed bytes directly, so the Rust engine (`L10.1`) can serve the quantized model and actually get the speed.

## 2. Principles

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $x \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times K}$ | activations, $M$ rows (1 for decode) | `float[M][K]` |
| $W \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times K}$ | the Linear weight, `[out, in]` as stored | never materialized |
| $y = x W^\top$ | the output | `float[M][N]` |
| $G$ | `group`: columns that share one scale | `int64_t` |
| $q_{nk} \in \{-8, \dots, 7\}$ | the 4-bit code of $W_{nk}$ | 4 bits |
| $s_{n,g}$ | the scale of row $n$, group $g = \lfloor k / G \rfloor$ | IEEE f16 |
| $W_{nk} = q_{nk}\, s_{n, \lfloor k/G \rfloor}$ | the value the code stands for | |
| $\ell$ | a lane index, $0 \le \ell < 8$ | |

### 2.1 Why quantized decode is faster: bytes per weight

A decode step multiplies one activation row by every weight matrix: $2NK$ FLOPs for $NK$ weights, one multiply-add per weight loaded. The arithmetic intensity is about 0.5 FLOP per byte in float32, far below what a core can compute per byte of bandwidth (`L9.1` 2.1), so the step takes as long as it takes to *read* the weights. int4 with groups of 32 stores $4 + 16/32 = 4.5$ bits per weight, a factor of 7.1 fewer bytes; int8 per channel stores about 8. The kernel can spend several instructions per weight on unpacking and still win, as long as it keeps up with memory.

### 2.2 The int4 layout

`formats/safetensors.md` (shared with `L8.5`, which writes it, and `L10.1`, which loads it) fixes:

- `qweight`: `uint8 [N, K/2]`. Byte $b$ of row $n$ holds column $2b$ in its **low** nibble (bits 0 to 3) and column $2b + 1$ in its **high** nibble (bits 4 to 7).
- Each nibble is **signed 4-bit two's complement**: the unsigned value $u \in [0, 15]$ means $u$ when $u < 8$ and $u - 16$ otherwise, so `0x8` is $-8$ and `0xF` is $-1$. In C: `u - ((u & 8) << 1)`.
- `scales`: `f16 [N, K/G]`, the raw bit patterns of IEEE half precision (1 sign, 5 exponent, 10 mantissa bits). Decoded by your `tl_f16_to_f32` from `M09.4`, not by shifting into the top of a float32, which is what bfloat16 would be.

The kernel validates the shape before touching anything: $K$ even (two codes per byte), $G$ even and positive (a group is whole bytes), $K$ a multiple of $G$ (whole groups); otherwise `TL_ESHAPE`.

### 2.3 Fusing the dequantization

Dequantize-then-multiply would write $W$ in float32 (as many bytes as the model you were trying not to read) and read it back. The fused kernel instead factors each group's scale out of its sum:

$$y_{mn} = \sum_{k} x_{mk}\, q_{nk}\, s_{n, \lfloor k/G \rfloor} = \sum_{g} s_{n,g} \underbrace{\sum_{k \in g} x_{mk}\, q_{nk}}_{\text{partial}_g} .$$

One multiply by the scale per group instead of one per weight, and the codes are turned into floats only in a small buffer: 64 at a time (32 bytes), consumed by the next loop while they are still in L1. int8 is the same with one group per row: $y_{mn} = s_n \sum_k x_{mk} q_{nk}$.

### 2.4 Lanes: fast and still batch-invariant

A single running sum is a chain: each addition waits for the previous one, about 4 cycles on a modern core, so one chain caps the kernel at a quarter of an addition per cycle whatever the vector width. The kernel therefore keeps **8 independent lanes** per group: lane $\ell$ accumulates the products of positions $\ell, \ell + 8, \ell + 16, \dots$ of the group, in increasing order, and the compiler maps the 8 lanes onto vector registers (two 4-wide NEON or one 8-wide AVX register). At the end of the group the lanes combine in a fixed tree,

$$\text{partial}_g = \big((\ell_0 + \ell_1) + (\ell_2 + \ell_3)\big) + \big((\ell_4 + \ell_5) + (\ell_6 + \ell_7)\big),$$

and the output accumulates $s_{n,g}\,\text{partial}_g$ in increasing $g$. Every one of those steps depends only on $(m, n)$: not on $M$, not on the thread, not on the row's position. That keeps the batch invariance of `c/ABI.md` rule 10 (the order is fixed, though it is not a single left-to-right sum).

Two C details decide whether the lanes stay in registers. If the lane array is a parameter, the compiler must assume it could alias `x` or the code buffer and reloads it on every step; copying it into a local array and marking the pointers `restrict` lets the lanes live in registers. In the reference that one change took the kernel from 1.75 ms to 0.99 ms per step. And `#pragma STDC FP_CONTRACT OFF` keeps the compiler from fusing a multiply and an add on some paths but not others (`L9.1` 2.4).

### 2.5 Threads

Output rows $n$ split across `rt.03` workers in ranges of 8; each $y_{mn}$ is computed entirely by one worker with the arithmetic above, so threads never change the bits.

## 3. Worked example by hand

$W$ is $2 \times 4$, $G = 2$, $x = [1, 2, 3, 4]$, $M = 1$:

| Row | codes $q$ | scales $s$ (f16 bits) | bytes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | $[1, -2 \mid 3, -8]$ | $[0.5 \mid 2]$ = `0x3800`, `0x4000` | `0xE1`, `0x83` |
| 1 | $[7, 0 \mid -1, 4]$ | $[1 \mid 0.25]$ = `0x3C00`, `0x3400` | `0x07`, `0x4F` |

Packing row 0: $1 = $ `0x1` (low), $-2 = 16 - 2 = 14 = $ `0xE` (high), so byte 0 is `0xE1`; $3 = $ `0x3`, $-8 = $ `0x8`, byte 1 is `0x83`. Row 1: `0x07` and ($-1 = $ `0xF` low, $4$ high) `0x4F`.

Decoding byte `0xE1`: low nibble $1 < 8$ gives $1$; high nibble $14 \ge 8$ gives $14 - 16 = -2$.

$$y_0 = 0.5\,(1 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot (-2)) + 2\,(3 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot (-8)) = 0.5 \cdot (-3) + 2 \cdot (-23) = -47.5$$

$$y_1 = 1\,(1 \cdot 7 + 2 \cdot 0) + 0.25\,(3 \cdot (-1) + 4 \cdot 4) = 7 + 0.25 \cdot 13 = 10.25$$

Every value is exact in float32. With the same codes as int8 and one scale per row ($0.5$ and $0.25$): $y = [0.5 \cdot (1 - 4 + 9 - 32), 0.25 \cdot (7 + 0 - 3 + 16)] = [-13, 5]$. These are `hand_example`, `q8_hand_example`, and `test_hand_example_through_ctypes` (which also checks numpy packs the bytes above).

## 4. The interface

```c
/* tinyllm/qmatmul.h: y [M, N] = x [M, K] @ W^T, W [N, K] quantized */
tl_status tl_matmul_q4_f32(const float *x, const uint8_t *wq, const uint16_t *scales_f16,
                           float *y, int64_t M, int64_t N, int64_t K, int64_t group, tl_pool *tp);
tl_status tl_matmul_q8_f32(const float *x, const int8_t *wq, const float *scales,
                           float *y, int64_t M, int64_t N, int64_t K, tl_pool *tp);
/* TL_ESHAPE: K odd, group odd or <= 0, K % group != 0. TL_EINVAL: negative dims,
   NULL pointers. M or N == 0: no-op. K == 0: y = 0. */
```

### What the tests check

| Test | KIND | Checks | Why it matters downstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hand_example` | unit, smoke | section 3 exactly | the nibble order, the sign, the scale per group |
| `q8_hand_example` | unit | the int8 version of section 3 | one scale per row |
| `every_nibble_code` | boundary | all 16 codes in both nibbles decode to $0..7, -8..-1$ | an unsigned or swapped decode is caught exactly |
| `f16_scales_decode_exactly` | boundary | the f16 bits `0x0001` ($2^{-24}$) and `0x3555` | half precision, not bfloat16 |
| `matches_dequantize_then_matmul` | differential | groups 2, 32, 64, and all of $K = 384$ against dequantize + your `tl_matmul_f32` | the fused kernel equals the obvious recipe |
| `q8_matches_dequantize_then_matmul` | differential | $K = 200$ (not a multiple of the chunk) against the same recipe | int8 per channel |
| `batch_invariant_rows` | property | 12 rows alone vs in batches, bitwise | decode and batched decode agree |
| `shape_and_argument_errors` | boundary | `TL_ESHAPE` and `TL_EINVAL` cases leave $y$ untouched; empty dims; $K = 0$ | errors before any read |
| `pool_result_equals_serial_bitwise` | property | 4 threads vs serial, $N = 37$ | threads never change bits |
| `test_hand_example_through_ctypes` | unit, smoke | numpy packs section 3's bytes; the kernel returns $[-47.5, 10.25]$ | the layout from Python |
| `test_q4_matches_dequantize_then_numpy` | differential | $K = 576$, groups 32, 64, 192, $M = 1$ and 5, against float64 | SmolLM2-sized projections |
| `test_q8_matches_dequantize_then_numpy` | differential | int8, $K = 300$ | the int8 scheme |
| `test_matches_your_l8_5_quantizer` | differential | your `quantize_int4_group` and `quantize_int8_per_channel` output, against `dequantize` | P6: exactly what `L10.1` will feed it |
| `test_eshape_raises_through_the_loader` | boundary | a group that does not divide $K$ arrives as `TlError` with `TL_ESHAPE` | the error path end to end |

The bench (`ss bench L9.5`, local only) runs one decode step, $M = 1$, $N = K = 2048$, group 32, and reports `q4_speedup_vs_f32` (budget $\ge 2$; the reference reaches about 3.9) and the int8 ratio.

## 5. Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Caught by |
|---|---|---|
| reading nibbles as unsigned $0..15$ | negative weights become large positive ones | `every_nibble_code` (mutant `s01`) |
| the high nibble as the even column | columns swapped in pairs: plausible, wrong | `every_nibble_code` (mutant `s02`) |
| indexing scales by group only, not by row | every row uses row 0's scales | `hand_example` (mutant `s03`) |
| not resetting the partial sum per group | each scale multiplies the sum of all earlier groups too | `hand_example` (mutant `s04`) |
| decoding the f16 scale as bfloat16 | scales off by orders of magnitude | `f16_scales_decode_exactly` (mutant `s05`) |
| unpacking at the chunk offset instead of the group's | every group reads the first group's codes | `matches_dequantize_then_matmul` (mutant `s06`) |
| the int8 scale indexed by the activation row | wrong for $M > 1$ only | `q8_matches_dequantize_then_matmul` (mutant `s07`) |
| forgetting the int8 scale | outputs 50 to 1000 times too large | `q8_hand_example` (mutant `s08`) |
| a special summation order for $M = 1$ | decode and batched decode differ in the last bit | `batch_invariant_rows` (mutant `s09`) |
| accepting a group that does not divide $K$ | reads past `x` and the weights | `shape_and_argument_errors` (mutant `s10`) |
| skipping the NULL check on the weights | a crash instead of `TL_EINVAL` | `shape_and_argument_errors` (mutant `s11`) |
| a pooled partition that drops a row | wrong only with threads | `pool_result_equals_serial_bitwise` (mutant `s12`) |
| accumulating through a pointer parameter | correct but about 1.8 times slower: the lanes are reloaded every step | the bench (ss bench L9.5, local only; no course test checks speed) |

## 6. Where it's used next

| Direction | Module | How it uses this |
|---|---|---|
| Back | `rt.01` | the loader and the error slot |
| Back | `rt.03` | `tl_parallel_for` over output rows |
| Back | `M09.4` | `tl_f16_to_f32` decodes every scale (and `tl_f32_to_f16` encodes them in the tests) |
| Back | `L9.1` | the float32 baseline: dequantize, then `tl_matmul_f32`; the bench's comparison |
| Back | `L8.5` | the quantizer and the byte layout this kernel decodes |
| Forward | `L10.1` | (Pass 7) the Rust runner loads `*.q4.safetensors` and calls `tl_matmul_q4_f32` for every quantized projection; its logits are compared with your `L8.5` Python on the same weights |

## Going further

| Your piece | Production equivalent | What it adds | Where to look |
|---|---|---|---|
| int4 with f16 group scales | llama.cpp `Q4_0`, `Q4_K` | blocks of 32 with the scale stored inline next to the codes (one cache line), super-blocks with 6-bit sub-scales | `ggml/src/ggml-quants.c` |
| W4A32 | W4A8 / W4A16 kernels | activations quantized too, integer dot products (`sdot`, VNNI) | llama.cpp `ggml_vec_dot_q4_0_q8_0` |
| absmax quantization | GPTQ, AWQ | choose codes to minimize the layer's output error, not each weight's | the GPTQ and AWQ papers |
| CPU GEMV | Marlin, ExLlamaV2 | GPU kernels that reach memory bandwidth at batch sizes up to 16 | IST-DASLab `marlin` |
