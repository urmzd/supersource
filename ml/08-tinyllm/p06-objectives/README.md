# Part 6: Objectives and Adaptation

One architecture, many objectives. GPT's causal language modeling (with GPT-2 weight loading), BERT's masked LM, ELECTRA's replaced-token detection, and T5's span corruption (optional); fine-tuning heads for sequences, tokens, and rewards, with the linear-head export the gateway's usage policy uses; LoRA with PiSSA initialization; and the evaluation harness behind the model-zoo table every architecture in the course reports to.

**Course passes**: 5 (L6.1 to L6.7, milestone MS-L6, part of gate MS-P5)

**Before you start**: the just-in-time math `M01.4`, `M07.5`, `M07.7` and the solve part `S-M07d`; the transformer of [Part 5](../p05-transformer-2017/).

## Key ideas

- **The objective decides what the model learns**: predicting the next token gives a generator, reconstructing masked tokens gives an encoder, detecting replaced tokens trains on every position.
- **LoRA** freezes $W$ and learns $W + BA$ with rank $r$; PiSSA initializes $A$ and $B$ from the top singular vectors of $W$.
- **Evaluation is a measurement with error bars**: strided perplexity, log-likelihood multiple choice, and paired comparisons with confidence intervals (`L6.7`).
