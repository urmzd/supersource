# Security

## Overview

- **Primary references**: Shostack, *Threat Modeling: Designing for Security* (Wiley); OWASP, [Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html) (free)
- **Supplementary**: [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/) (free); [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) and [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) SBOM specs (free); [OWASP ASVS](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) (free); OWASP, [Top 10 for LLM Applications](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/) (free)
- **Prerequisites**: [Diagramming & the C4 Model](../05-diagramming-c4/) (the data-flow diagram you threat-model), the full system from course Passes 1 to 10
- **Estimated time**: 1 to 2 weeks in course Pass 11

## Key Takeaways

- **Threat modeling asks four questions**: what are we building, what can go wrong, what are we going to do about it, and did we do a good job.
- **STRIDE per element of a data-flow diagram** (spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, elevation of privilege) makes "what can go wrong" systematic.
- **Trust boundaries are where checks belong**: every boundary in the system's interface matrix, including retrieved text reaching a tool call, gets a named control and a test.
- **Supply chain is part of the system**: an SBOM per artifact and provenance for builds tell you what you shipped when the next CVE lands.

## How to Study

Read the OWASP cheat sheet, then Shostack part I. Draw your system's data-flow diagram before reading further. In the course, `craft.17` writes `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` with every trust boundary of your system, `craft.18` adds SBOMs and build provenance, and `craft.19` reviews secrets handling and authorization paths.

# Concepts & Techniques

## Core Insight

Security is a property of the whole system, so it is reviewed against the whole system's diagram. The threat model turns the architecture into a list of threats, each tied to a control and a test, and the supply-chain records make the shipped artifacts accountable.

## 1. Threat modeling your system

**Key ideas**:
- **DFD**: processes, data stores, external entities, data flows, trust boundaries; built from your C4 container view.
- **STRIDE per element** with a control and an owner per threat, including the RAG-to-tools path (`craft.17`).

## 2. Supply chain, secrets, and authorization

**Key ideas**:
- **SBOM and provenance** for every image and binary (`craft.18`).
- **Secrets and authz review** (`craft.19`): where keys live (`TL_API_KEY`, HMAC peppers), how scopes and tenants are checked in the gateway (`gw.02`).
