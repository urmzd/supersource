# Language and Tool Primers

Just enough of each language and tool to build the course system, each placed immediately before the first module that needs it (design decision D38). A learner starting from high-school algebra meets Python, the shell, C, Rust, HTTP, Go, containers, and Kubernetes in the first two passes; these primers are where each one is introduced from first principles.

## Overview

- **What a primer is**: a `practice` module (`lang.01` to `lang.11`): one chapter plus small exercises in your course repo's `primers/<id>/`, checked by `ss check <id>`. The exercises are not part of the system; they are the smallest artifacts that exercise the ideas the next module relies on.
- **Prerequisites**: none for `lang.01`; each later primer names its own.
- **Estimated time**: 2 to 4 hours per primer.

## Key Takeaways

- Every primer ends in a checked artifact, so "I read about it" becomes "my code passes".
- Each primer teaches only what its first call site needs, and its last section names that call site.
- Primers have no code call site of their own: later modules list them under `reading`, so they never block an `ss check`. The pass gates (MS-P0, MS-P1) require them.

## How to Study

- Read the chapter's sections 1 and 2 before you open an editor; do section 3 on paper.
- `ss tests <id>` before writing code: each test says why it exists.
- When a test fails, its `WHY:` line names the pitfall from section 5.

## Primer plan

| lang.02 | Shell, git, make, processes: exit codes, signals, environment, pipes | craft.01, every `ss` verdict | P0 |
| lang.03 | C: memory, pointers, structs, the C11 toolchain, sanitizers, headers and linkage | rt.01, M03.1 | P1 |
| lang.04 | Rust: ownership, traits, `Result`, cargo workspaces, std TCP | L10.0, ds.05, L1.5 | P1 |
| lang.05 | HTTP/1.1, JSON, and Server-Sent Events from the wire up | L10.0, gw.00 | P1 |
| lang.06 | Go: packages, interfaces, goroutines, channels, `context`, `net/http`, `testing` | gw.00, dur.01, load.01 | P1 |
| lang.07 | Containers and Kubernetes: images, layers, Pods, Deployments, Services, Helm, kind | dep.00 | P1 |
