# Shell, git, make, processes: exit codes, signals, environment, pipes

## Overview

|---|---|
| **Module** | `lang.02` · practice · C and shell · Pass 0 · 3 to 4 h |
| **You build** | `primers/lang.02/`: a `Makefile` for the given two-file C program (`main.c`, `greet.c`, `greet.h`), and `worker.sh`, a script that holds a lock file, traps SIGTERM and SIGINT, cleans up, and exits 128 + the signal number |
| **Contract** | none: a primer exercise, not part of the system |
| **Tests** | `course/tests/lang.02/`, run by its `check` script (what they check: section 4) |
| **Needs** | a terminal with `bash`, `make`, `cc`, `git`, and `uv` (`ss doctor`); [`lang.01`](01-python-and-numpy.md) comes first on the path |
| **Used by** | no code call site (a primer). It is the concept prerequisite of `craft.01` (your CI gate is processes and exit codes), every `ss` verdict (an exit code), `M03.1` and `rt.01` (your C `Makefile`), `L10.0` (your engine shuts down on SIGTERM), and `dep.00` (Kubernetes stops a pod with SIGTERM, then SIGKILL) |

## Key Takeaways

- **Every process ends with an exit status** from 0 to 255; 0 means success. `ss check`, CI, and Kubernetes all decide by that one number.
- **128 + n means "ended by signal n".** A trap that cleans up and exits 143 after SIGTERM keeps that information; a script without a trap is simply killed.
- **Bash runs a trap only between commands.** Sleep in the background and `wait`, or a 30 s `sleep` delays your shutdown by up to 30 s.
- **SIGKILL cannot be trapped**, so anything you clean up on exit can be left behind; the next start must detect stale state.
- **make rebuilds a target when a prerequisite is newer**, and it only knows the prerequisites you list: headers included.

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start lang.02                 # records the start; there is no stub: you write every file
ss tests lang.02                 # read the test catalog first
ss check lang.02                 # exit code is the verdict
```

## 1. Why now

Next, in craft.01, you set up the gate every later change to your system passes through: CI jobs that run commands and decide pass or fail by their exit status. From then on, `ss check` speaks to you in exit codes (0 pass, 1 fail, 3 blocked, 4 contract drift), your C code in Pass 1 is built by a `Makefile` you write, and your Rust engine and Go gateway run as processes that Kubernetes stops by sending SIGTERM and, 30 seconds later, SIGKILL. A server that ignores SIGTERM loses in-flight requests; a build that does not track headers ships objects compiled against an old struct layout; a script that ignores a failing command in a pipe reports green on a broken build. This primer teaches the process model those all share, on two small artifacts you can test in seconds.

## 2. Principles

### 2.1 Processes and exit status

A **process** is a running program. It has a numeric id (its **PID**), a parent process, an environment (2.3), and three open files numbered 0, 1, 2 (2.4). A shell runs a command by creating a child process and waiting for it. When the child ends, it reports an **exit status**, an integer from 0 to 255 (only the low 8 bits of `exit(n)` survive, so `exit 256` reports 0). The shell exposes it and a few other facts as special parameters:

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| `$?` | exit status of the last command | integer 0 to 255 |
| `$$` | PID of the current shell (in a script: the script's own PID) | integer |
| `$!` | PID of the last command started in the background with `&` | integer |
| `$1`, `$2`, ... | the script's arguments | strings |
| $n$ | a signal number: 2 for SIGINT, 9 for SIGKILL, 15 for SIGTERM | integer |
| $128 + n$ | the status a shell reports for a child ended by signal $n$ | integer |

Conventions every tool in this course follows: **0** success; **1** a general failure; **2** wrong usage (bad arguments); **126** found but not executable; **127** command not found; **$128 + n$** ended by signal $n$, so 130 after Ctrl-C, 137 after SIGKILL (what an out-of-memory kill looks like), 143 after SIGTERM.

Status drives control flow: `a && b` runs `b` only if `a` exited 0; `a || b` only if it did not. Three settings make scripts fail fast instead of carrying on after an error: `set -e` (exit when a command fails), `set -u` (an unset variable is an error), and `set -o pipefail` (2.4).

### 2.2 Signals

A **signal** is a small asynchronous message the kernel delivers to a process: "stop now", "you were interrupted". `kill -TERM 4242` sends SIGTERM to PID 4242; Ctrl-C in a terminal sends SIGINT. Each signal has a default action, and for these three it is "terminate":

| Signal | Number | Sent by | Can a process catch it? |
|---|---|---|---|
| SIGINT | 2 | Ctrl-C | yes |
| SIGTERM | 15 | `kill` with no option, Kubernetes, systemd, CI cancellation | yes |
| SIGKILL | 9 | `kill -9`, the out-of-memory killer, Kubernetes after the grace period | **no**: the process ends, nothing of it runs |

`kill -0 PID` sends nothing; it only tells you whether the process exists (status 0) or not.

In bash, `trap 'commands' TERM` replaces the default action with your commands. The rule that surprises everyone: **bash runs a trap only after the command it is currently running finishes.** While a foreground `sleep 30` runs, a SIGTERM waits. The builtin `wait`, however, returns as soon as a trapped signal arrives. So a script that must stop promptly starts its long waits in the background (`sleep 30 &`) and then `wait`s for them. Once the trap runs, the background child is still alive; the trap must kill it (`jobs -p` lists the PIDs of the shell's background children), or it lives on as an **orphan**.

### 2.3 Environment

The **environment** is a list of `NAME=value` strings each process carries. A child gets a **copy** of its parent's environment when it starts, so a child can never change its parent's variables. In bash, `export NAME=value` puts a variable into the environment of every later child; `NAME=value cmd` sets it for one command only. `${NAME:-default}` reads a variable and substitutes `default` when it is unset or empty. Configuration by environment variable is how your services are configured in Kubernetes (`TL_*` variables, 2.16 of the design) and how `ss` points every command at your repo (`SS_COURSE_HOME`).

### 2.4 Files, pipes, redirection

Every process starts with **file descriptors** 0 (stdin), 1 (stdout), and 2 (stderr). Programs print results to stdout and diagnostics to stderr, so the two can be separated: `cmd > out.txt 2> err.txt`; `2>&1` sends stderr wherever stdout goes. A **pipe** `a | b` connects a's stdout to b's stdin; both run at once. The status of a pipeline is the status of its **last** command: `grep x missing-file | wc -l` exits 0 even though grep failed, unless `set -o pipefail`, which makes the pipeline fail when any part fails.

### 2.5 The C build model and make

C is built in two stages. **Compiling** turns one `.c` file into one object file: `cc -c greet.c -o greet.o`. A **header** (`greet.h`) declares what another file defines, and `#include "greet.h"` pastes it into every `.c` that uses it. **Linking** combines object files into a program: `cc main.o greet.o -o greet`. Compiling separately is what makes rebuilds cheap: change `greet.c` and only `greet.o` needs compiling again.

**make** automates exactly that decision. A Makefile is a list of **rules**:

```make
target: prerequisite1 prerequisite2
	recipe line run by the shell (it must start with a TAB character)
```

To build a target, make first brings each prerequisite up to date, then runs the recipe **if the target file does not exist or is older than any prerequisite** (by modification time). Plain `make` builds the first target in the file. Pieces you will use:

| Piece | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CC`, `CFLAGS` | variables for the compiler and its flags; `make CC=clang` overrides them from the command line |
| `$@`, `$<`, `$^` | in a recipe: the target, the first prerequisite, all prerequisites |
| `%.o: %.c` | a **pattern rule**: how to make any `.o` from the `.c` of the same name |
| `main.o: greet.h` | a rule with no recipe: adds a prerequisite to `main.o`, because make cannot see `#include` |
| `.PHONY: clean` | `clean` is a name, not a file; run its recipe every time it is asked for |

### 2.6 git

git records **snapshots**. A **commit** is a full snapshot of the tracked files, plus a message, an author, a time, and a pointer to its parent commit, all named by a hash of that content. You choose what goes into the next snapshot by **staging**: `git add file` copies the file's current content into the staging area, and `git commit -m "..."` turns the staging area into a commit. `git status` shows what changed and what is staged; `git log` walks the parents from the newest commit (**HEAD**); `git diff` shows unstaged changes. `.gitignore` lists files git should never offer to track (build outputs like `*.o`, `.venv/`, `.ss/`). A **branch** is a movable name for a commit; a **remote** is another copy of the repository you `git push` to. git runs **hooks**, scripts in a hooks directory, at fixed moments: craft.01 uses the `commit-msg` hook, which gets the message file and can reject the commit with a nonzero exit status.

## 3. Worked example by hand

**Who gets rebuilt.** The program has three source files. Both `.c` files include `greet.h`:

```text
greet  <-  main.o  <-  main.c, greet.h
       <-  greet.o <-  greet.c, greet.h
```

Starting from a complete build, make rebuilds exactly the targets downstream of the file you change:

| You change | Recompiled | Relinked | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| nothing | nothing | no | every target is newer than its prerequisites |
| `greet.c` | `greet.o` | yes | `greet.o` is now older than `greet.c`; `greet` is then older than `greet.o` |
| `main.c` | `main.o` | yes | same, on the other side |
| `greet.h` | `main.o` and `greet.o` | yes | both list `greet.h` as a prerequisite |
| `greet.h`, header rules forgotten | nothing | no | make never learns that the header matters: stale objects |

**A worker's life.** A session with the reference `worker.sh` (state in `/tmp/w`, a tick every 30 s):

```text
$ WORKER_STATE_DIR=/tmp/w ./worker.sh &        # PID 4242
ready
tick
$ cat /tmp/w/worker.lock
4242
$ kill -TERM 4242                               # trap runs at once: wait returns early
$ wait 4242; echo $?
143                                             # 128 + 15
$ ls /tmp/w/worker.lock
ls: /tmp/w/worker.lock: No such file or directory
```

Exit statuses to recognize: 128 + 2 = **130** (SIGINT), 128 + 9 = **137** (SIGKILL; no trap ran, so a lock file stays behind), 128 + 15 = **143** (SIGTERM).

**The program.** `./greet Ada` prints `hello, Ada` and exits 0; `./greet` with no argument prints `usage: ./greet NAME` on stderr and exits 2.

## 4. The artifact and its check

Make `primers/lang.02/` in your repo and put these three files in it exactly as written. You do not change them; you write the build for them.

```c
/* primers/lang.02/greet.h */
#ifndef GREET_H
#define GREET_H

#include <stddef.h>

/* Write "hello, <name>" into buf (at most cap bytes, NUL-terminated).
   Returns the length it wanted to write, as snprintf does. */
int greet(char *buf, size_t cap, const char *name);

#endif
```

```c
/* primers/lang.02/greet.c */
#include <stdio.h>

#include "greet.h"

int greet(char *buf, size_t cap, const char *name) {
    return snprintf(buf, cap, "hello, %s", name);
}
```

```c
/* primers/lang.02/main.c: exit codes 0 ok, 1 runtime error, 2 usage error */
#include <stdio.h>

#include "greet.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    char buf[64];
    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s NAME\n", argv[0]);
        return 2;
    }
    int n = greet(buf, sizeof buf, argv[1]);
    if (n < 0 || (size_t)n >= sizeof buf) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s: name too long\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }
    puts(buf);
    return 0;
}
```

**The Makefile** (`primers/lang.02/Makefile`) must:

1. build `greet` from `main.o` and `greet.o` when you run plain `make`, compiling each `.c` to its own `.o` and linking with `$(CC)`;
2. rebuild only what is downstream of a changed file (the table in section 3), headers included;
3. compile and link through `$(CC)`, so `make CC=clang` works;
4. have a `clean` target that removes `greet` and the objects, declared `.PHONY`.

**The worker** (`primers/lang.02/worker.sh`, executable, starting with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`) must:

1. keep its state in `${WORKER_STATE_DIR:-${TMPDIR:-/tmp}}` and tick every `${WORKER_INTERVAL:-30}` seconds;
2. on start, if `worker.lock` exists in the state directory and the PID in it is alive (`kill -0`), print why on stderr and exit 1 without touching the lock; if that PID is gone, remove the stale lock and continue;
3. write its own PID (`$$`) to `worker.lock`, set its traps, then print `ready` as its first line on stdout;
4. on SIGTERM exit 143, on SIGINT exit 130, in both cases after removing the lock and killing any background child, promptly even while it waits out a 30 s interval.

**The check.** `ss check lang.02` runs `course/tests/lang.02/check` in your repo. It refuses early if `make`, `cc`, `uv`, or one of the five files is missing, then runs the tests with pytest (`uv run --no-project --with pytest`). The make tests work in a scratch copy of the directory, so your repo stays clean.

### What the tests check

| Test | KIND | Checks | Why it matters downstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test_make_builds_a_program_that_runs` | unit | `make` builds `greet`; `./greet Ada` prints `hello, Ada` with status 0; no argument gives status 2 | your C library is built the same way in Pass 1 |
| `test_second_make_rebuilds_nothing` | unit | an up-to-date build does no work | fast edit-build loops |
| `test_editing_one_source_rebuilds_only_its_object` | unit | `greet.c` changed: only `greet.o` and the link | incremental builds |
| `test_editing_the_header_rebuilds_both_objects` | boundary | `greet.h` changed: both objects | no stale struct layouts against `tinyllm.h` |
| `test_make_uses_the_cc_variable` | unit | compile and link go through `$(CC)` | sanitizer builds and CI choose the compiler |
| `test_clean_works_even_when_a_file_named_clean_exists` | boundary | `clean` is `.PHONY` | phony targets always run |
| `test_worker_is_an_executable_script` | unit | execute bit and a `#!` line | entry points are exec'd, by CI and by Kubernetes |
| `test_worker_writes_its_pid_to_the_lock` | unit | `worker.lock` holds the worker's PID after `ready` | the section 3 session |
| `test_sigterm_exits_143_and_removes_the_lock` | unit | SIGTERM: status 143, lock gone | graceful shutdown in `L10.0` and `dep.00` |
| `test_sigint_exits_130_and_removes_the_lock` | unit | SIGINT: status 130, lock gone | Ctrl-C behaves too |
| `test_trap_runs_promptly_during_a_long_sleep` | boundary | with a 30 s interval, SIGTERM ends it within 3 s | shutdown inside the grace period |
| `test_no_process_is_left_behind` | boundary | no process of the worker's group outlives it | no orphans per restart |
| `test_second_start_refuses_while_the_first_runs` | unit | a second start exits 1 and leaves the lock alone | one owner of the lock |
| `test_stale_lock_after_sigkill_is_recovered` | fault | after SIGKILL the lock remains; the next start takes it over | crash recovery without a human |

## 5. Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Caught by |
|---|---|---|
| 1. A rule whose target never exists as a file (for example `build:` producing `greet`) | every `make` relinks or recompiles everything | `test_second_make_rebuilds_nothing` |
| 2. One rule `cc main.c greet.c -o greet` | every change recompiles every file | `test_editing_one_source_rebuilds_only_its_object` |
| 3. No `main.o: greet.h` and `greet.o: greet.h` | after a header change the objects are stale and disagree with it | `test_editing_the_header_rebuilds_both_objects` |
| 4. A recipe that hardcodes `gcc` | `make CC=clang` and sanitizer builds are ignored | `test_make_uses_the_cc_variable` |
| 5. `clean` not declared `.PHONY` | a stray file called `clean` makes `make clean` do nothing | `test_clean_works_even_when_a_file_named_clean_exists` |
| 6. No trap | the shell dies with the signal (status shown as -15 by Python), the lock stays | `test_sigterm_exits_143_and_removes_the_lock` |
| 7. A foreground `sleep "$interval"` | SIGTERM waits up to 30 s for the sleep to finish | `test_trap_runs_promptly_during_a_long_sleep` |
| 8. The trap forgets the background `sleep` | one orphaned process per restart | `test_no_process_is_left_behind` |
| 9. Trusting any existing lock | after one SIGKILL the worker never starts again | `test_stale_lock_after_sigkill_is_recovered` |
| 10. Spaces instead of a TAB before a recipe line | `Makefile:9: *** missing separator.  Stop.` | `test_make_builds_a_program_that_runs` |

## 6. Where it's used next

| Direction | Module | How it uses this |
|---|---|---|
| Forward | `craft.01` | CI jobs are processes whose exit status is the gate; the `commit-msg` hook is a script that rejects with a nonzero status |
| Forward | `M03.1` | the C exercise's Makefile builds standalone test binaries from source files and headers |
| Forward | `rt.01` | the same Makefile gains `SANITIZE=1` (a variable, 2.5) to add AddressSanitizer |
| Forward | `L10.0` | your Rust engine handles SIGTERM: stop accepting, finish in-flight streams, exit |
| Forward | `dep.00` | Kubernetes sends SIGTERM, waits the grace period (30 s by default), then SIGKILL; status 137 in `kubectl describe` means SIGKILL |
| Forward | `ops.00` | the first drill reads a crashlooping pod's exit status and restart count |

A primer has no code call site, so no module's `ss check` blocks on it. MS-P0 does: it requires a fresh pass of `lang.02`.

## Going further

| Your piece | Production equivalent | What it adds | Where to look |
|---|---|---|---|
| header rules in the `Makefile` | `cc -MMD -MP` dependency files, Ninja | the compiler writes the header list for you; a faster scheduler | GNU Make manual, "Generating Prerequisites Automatically" |
| the worker's lock file | `flock(1)`, `fcntl` locks | the kernel releases the lock when the process dies, so there is no stale lock and no check-then-write race | `man 1 flock` (util-linux) |
| the TERM trap | `tini`, `docker run --init` | a minimal PID 1 that forwards signals and reaps orphans inside a container | krallin/tini `README.md` |
| exit 143 on SIGTERM | Kubernetes pod termination | `preStop` hooks, `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, readiness removal before SIGTERM | kubernetes.io, "Pod Lifecycle", termination of Pods |
