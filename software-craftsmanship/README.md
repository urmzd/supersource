# Software Craftsmanship

The engineering practices, principles, and culture that separate senior/staff engineers from everyone else. How to write software that survives contact with reality, how to make a system legible to someone who was not there when it was built, and the type theory beneath the languages you use every day.

> **Prerequisites**: Some professional programming experience (this is a "how to think" track, not a "how to code" track). [07 Type Systems](07-type-systems/) also wants [Discrete Math 1](../math/05-discrete-math-1/) (proofs, induction, relations).

- **Estimated time**: 3-4 weeks at 6-8 hrs/week for 01 to 04; 1 week each for 05 and 06; 2-3 weeks for 07; the course practices (08 to 12) are paced by the [course](../paths/course/)

## Key Takeaways

- Good software is not about clever code: it is about managing complexity over time.
- The Pragmatic Programmer teaches individual craft; SWE at Google teaches organizational craft at scale.
- **Testing is a practice, not a phase**: tests, docs, and diagrams are first-class, executable specifications.
- **Legibility is a deliverable.** A diagram you can `git diff` beats a screenshot nobody can edit; a document checked against reality beats tribal knowledge. Both survive only when they are treated like source: co-located, reviewed in PRs, rendered and checked in CI.
- **Types are a theory, not a syntax.** Soundness is progress plus preservation; Algorithm W infers `a -> a` for `\x. x` with no annotations; "generic or interface?" and "why isn't `List<Dog>` a `List<Animal>`?" are consequences, not folklore.
- Staff+ engineers are distinguished by judgment calls about trade-offs, not raw coding ability.
- The principles are cheapest to learn from **someone else's postmortem**: most costly mistakes take under 30 minutes to prevent.

## How to Study

- Read one chapter per day from each book: they complement each other.
- After each chapter, identify one thing you can apply to your current project.
- The Pragmatic Programmer is best read cover-to-cover; SWE at Google can be read selectively.
- Topics 03, 05, 06, and 08 to 12 also host course modules (`craft.*`, `lang.*`): work those chapters in course order with `ss start <ID>` and `ss check <ID>`, against your own system.

## Diagrams and documentation

This part of the track (05 and 06, formerly the separate Diagramming & Documentation track) treats the **understandability of a system as a first-class engineering deliverable**. The diagrams use one running example, **Streamflow**, an event-driven order platform, so the C4 views built in 05 are a real system you also learn to operate in the [Infrastructure](../infrastructure/) track. The sources live in [`05-diagramming-c4/diagrams/`](05-diagramming-c4/diagrams/) as `.d2` **and** rendered `.svg`:

![Streamflow system context (C4 Level 1)](05-diagramming-c4/diagrams/c4-context.svg)

In the course you draw your own system the same way (`craft.09`), keep decision records from Pass 1 (`craft.02`), and write runbooks for every alert (`craft.10`).

## Programming languages

Topic 07 (formerly the separate Programming Languages track) treats languages as a **subject with a theory**. It leads with the math, the lambda-calculus ladder (STLC to System F to Hindley-Milner), unification, and variance, then shows the same concept across type systems that made different trade-offs: structural (TypeScript, Go), nominal (Rust, Haskell, OCaml), inferred (the ML family). Its `code/` folder holds a from-scratch Hindley-Milner inferencer ([`hindley_milner.py`](07-type-systems/code/hindley_milner.py)) and the same `Shape`/`Stack`/`largest` example in five languages. In the course it is the optional side quest `sq.type-systems`. Further topics (parsing and compilers, semantics, effect systems) would build on it.

## Quick Start

1. **Want individual craft?** Start with 01: DRY, orthogonality, reversibility, design by contract.
2. **Leading a team or codebase?** 02: code review, Hyrum's Law, deprecation budgets, CI as leverage.
3. **Tests always feel like a chore?** 03 reframes testing as a *mentality* applied to code, infra, data, docs, and diagrams.
4. **About to start a time-boxed build?** 04: 13 failure modes from real projects, each cheap to prevent and expensive to live with.
5. **Never made a diagram you could version-control?** 05: install `d2`, render the C4 set, then diff a change. Docs always go stale? 06 (Diátaxis plus docs-as-code).
6. **"Generics vs interfaces" always feels fuzzy?** 07: the Strachey/Cardelli taxonomy names the four kinds of polymorphism; run the HM inferencer.
7. **Building the course system?** Follow [the course path](../paths/course/); topics 08 to 12 are its practice chapters.
