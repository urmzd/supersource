"""Airflow DAG: the end-to-end Streamflow orders pipeline, wired as one graph.

This is the orchestration layer -- it runs the right tasks in the right order,
retries transient failures, and makes every run safely re-runnable. It chains
the two earlier stages into a single DAG:

    bronze_to_silver (Spark, topic 03)
        -> check_source_freshness (dbt)
        -> dbt_run   (build staging -> intermediate -> marts)
        -> dbt_test  (schema + custom tests; fails the run on bad data)

Concepts made concrete:
  * The DAG: tasks + dependencies; the scheduler runs a task only after its
    upstreams succeed (topological order -- see algorithms/06-graphs).
  * Idempotency: every task is sliced by the run's logical date ({{ ds }}), so a
    retry or a backfill for one day overwrites exactly that day -- no dupes.
  * Retries & backoff: transient failures retry with exponential backoff before
    the task is marked failed and alerts fire.
  * Quality gate: dbt_test runs AFTER the build; if an invariant breaks, the run
    fails loudly instead of publishing confidently-wrong marts.
