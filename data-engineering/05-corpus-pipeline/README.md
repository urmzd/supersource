- **Prerequisites**: [Data Engineering Foundations](../01-foundations/), [Storage & Warehousing](../02-storage-warehousing/) (columnar files), the asyncio primer `lang.08`, the [responsible-AI topics on licensing and PII](../../responsible-ai/)
- **Estimated time**: 3 to 4 weeks in course Pass 3, plus one module in Pass 8 when the pipeline becomes a durable workflow

## Key Takeaways

- **Data quality bounds model quality.** Filtering, deduplication, and decontamination change a model's loss and its benchmark numbers more than most architecture choices at small scale.
- **A pipeline is a composition of streaming stages** over one `Doc` type: fetch, normalize, filter, exact dedup, near dedup, PII scrub, shard, tokenize. Each stage is a generator, so memory stays flat on any corpus size.
- **Deduplication has two halves**: exact (hashes, confirmed by sort-merge) and near (MinHash signatures, LSH banding, union-find clusters). Decontamination is near-dedup against your eval sets.
- **Every output byte traces to a licensed source.** The ledger records license and provenance per source; a shard whose source is unknown or not allowlisted fails the build.
- **Determinism is a feature**: the same config gives the same output hash regardless of worker count, which is what makes a durable, resumable pipeline possible later.

## How to Study

Read the FineWeb paper end to end (it documents each filter's measured effect), then skim datatrove's pipeline stages. Work the MinHash and LSH chapter of *Mining of Massive Datasets* by hand for a 3-band example. In the course, build `data.01` to `data.08` in Pass 3 after the tokenizers, and `data.09` in Pass 8 once the durable engine exists.

# Concepts & Techniques

## Core Insight

A training corpus is the output of a program, and like any program it has bugs, tests, and provenance. Treating the corpus as code means stages with typed interfaces, tests on hand-labelled fixtures, a manifest with content hashes, and a ledger that answers "where did this text come from and may we use it" for every shard.

## 1. Fetch and stages

**Key ideas**:
- **Async fetch** with resume via HTTP `Range`, checksums, and quarantine on mismatch (`data.01`).
- **Stages** are `Callable[[Iterator[Doc]], Iterator[Doc]]`, composed with `compose` (`data.02`): Unicode normalization, language ID, Gopher rules, repetition filters, and a perplexity filter that plugs in the `L2.1` n-gram model in C1.

## 2. Deduplication and decontamination

**Key ideas**:
- **Exact**: paragraph hashes, a Bloom screen (`ds.08`), then a sort-merge confirm so no true document is dropped (`data.03`).
- **Near**: MinHash with 128 permutations, LSH with $b$ bands of $r$ rows (threshold about $(1/b)^{1/r}$), union-find clusters, process-parallel and worker-count invariant (`data.04`).
- **Decontamination**: drop any document that shares a 13-gram with a protected eval or validation set, and record the count.

## 3. Privacy, shards, and tokens

**Key ideas**:
- **PII scrub** with typed placeholders and audit spans (`data.05`; policy in `ethics.02`).
- **Parquet shards** and a manifest, with a document-hash train/val split (`data.06`).
- **Tokenize and pack** to the llm.c `.bin` format read by `L0.6` `TokenStream` (`data.07`).

## 4. Ledger, datasheet, and the durable pipeline

**Key ideas**:
- **Ledger verification** against `formats/ledger.schema.json` and a generated datasheet (`data.08`; policy in `ethics.01`).
- **`CorpusBuild`** runs the stages as subprocess activities on the learner's durable engine; a killed worker resumes and every shard is written once (`data.09`).

## Course modules

| Module | Topic | Kind | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data.01` | Async fetch with resume, checksums, license capture (ledger rows) | build | 3 |
| `data.02` | Extract, normalize, quality filters (generator stages) | build | 3 |
| `data.03` | Exact dedup: paragraph hashes, Bloom screen, sort-merge confirm | build | 3 |
| `data.04` | Near-dup MinHash + LSH + union-find, process-parallel; **decontamination** against protected eval and validation sets | build | 3 |
| `data.05` | PII scrub with typed placeholders and audit spans | build | 3 |
| `data.06` | Parquet shards, manifest, document-hash train/val split (uses `pyarrow`) | build | 3 |
| `data.07` | Tokenize and pack to llm.c `.bin` | build | 3 |
| `data.08` | Licensing ledger verification and datasheet | build | 3 |
| `data.09` | Pipeline as a durable workflow `CorpusBuild` | build | 8 |

Milestone `MS-corpus` closes the pipeline: shards, manifest, ledger, and `.bin` files pass the format conformance suite with a deterministic output hash across two runs and worker counts 1 and 4.

## Chapters

<!-- ss:chapters -->
No chapters yet: they arrive with authoring batch B5 (data.01 to data.08) and B10 (data.09) (course/DESIGN.md 9). `ss lint --fix-index` then fills this table from the registry.
