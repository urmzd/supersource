## Key Takeaways

- A limit describes what $f(x)$ approaches, not $f(a)$ itself; $0/0$ and $\infty - \infty$ are signals to rewrite, never answers (q1, q8).
- The product, quotient, and chain rules compute every derivative your autograd needs; the sigmoid, softplus, tanh, and SiLU derivatives are four lines each (q13 to q15, q21).
- An optimum of a smooth function sits where $f' = 0$ or on the boundary, and you still have to check which candidate wins (q36, q38).
- The fundamental theorem turns integrals into antiderivatives and makes $\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^{u(x)} f = f(u(x))\,u'(x)$ (q46, q47).
- L'Hôpital's rule turns $0/0$ and $\infty/\infty$ into a limit of derivatives, and only applies when that limit exists (q57).

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start S-M01             # writes solve/S-M01.toml and the three proof files
ss check S-M01             # SymPy checks the answers, then asks each proof rubric (y/n)
ss check S-M01 --regrade   # ask the rubrics again after you change a proof
```

## 1. Why now

In Pass 2 your system learns to learn. `M01.1` approximates derivatives with finite differences, `M01.3` writes the derivative of every activation function, and `M04.1` turns those into `gradcheck`, the test that guards every backward pass in `L0`. All of it assumes you can differentiate a formula by hand and know what a limit is, because a derivative is a limit and a finite difference is that limit stopped early. Training picks the weights that minimize a loss, which is optimization; the learning-rate schedules of `M10.4` and the area under an ROC curve (`M07.7`) are integrals. This set checks the pen and paper side of Calculus 1 before your code depends on it.

## 2. Principles

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$ | $f(x)$ gets arbitrarily close to $L$ as $x \ne a$ gets close to $a$ | real |
| $\varepsilon, \delta$ | positive tolerances in the definition of a limit | positive reals |
| $f'(x)$, $\frac{df}{dx}$ | the derivative, $\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$ | function |
| $f''(x)$ | the second derivative, the derivative of $f'$ | function |
| $\sigma(z)$ | the sigmoid, $1/(1 + e^{-z})$ | function |
| $F$ | an antiderivative of $f$: $F' = f$ | function |
| $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$ | the definite integral, the signed area under $f$ from $a$ to $b$ | real |
| $t$ | time, in related-rate problems | real |

### 2.1 Limits

$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$ means: for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $0 < |x - a| < \delta$ implies $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$. The value $f(a)$ plays no part, which is why $\frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}$ has a limit at 2 even though it is undefined there: for $x \ne 2$ it equals $x + 2$. Limits add, multiply, and divide (when the denominator's limit is not 0). Three standard limits do most of the work: $\frac{\sin u}{u} \to 1$ as $u \to 0$, $(1 + \frac{a}{x})^x \to e^a$ as $x \to \infty$, and for rational functions at infinity, only the highest powers matter. A **one-sided** limit restricts $x$ to one side of $a$. Forms like $0/0$, $\infty/\infty$, $\infty - \infty$, $0 \cdot \infty$, $1^\infty$, and $0^0$ are **indeterminate**: they say the problem needs rewriting (factor, multiply by a conjugate, take logarithms), not what the answer is.

### 2.2 Derivative rules

The derivative is the limit of the difference quotient. From that definition follow the rules you use instead of it: linearity; the **power rule** $\frac{d}{dx} x^n = n x^{n-1}$ for a constant $n$; $\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x$, $\frac{d}{dx} \ln x = \frac{1}{x}$, $\frac{d}{dx} \sin x = \cos x$, $\frac{d}{dx} \cos x = -\sin x$; the **product rule** $(fg)' = f'g + fg'$; the **quotient rule** $(f/g)' = (f'g - fg')/g^2$; and the **chain rule**, $\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = f'(g(x))\, g'(x)$: the outer derivative evaluated at the inner function, times the inner derivative. The chain rule is the whole of backpropagation (`M08.1` to `M08.3`). A variable exponent, as in $x^x$, needs $x^x = e^{x \ln x}$ first; the power rule does not apply.

### 2.3 Implicit differentiation and related rates

When $y$ is defined by an equation such as $x^2 + y^2 = 25$, differentiate both sides with respect to $x$, treating $y$ as a function of $x$ (so $\frac{d}{dx} y^2 = 2y\,y'$), and solve for $y'$. **Related rates** apply the same idea with time: if two quantities are tied by an equation and both change with $t$, differentiating the equation in $t$ ties their rates.

### 2.4 Optimization

At an interior minimum or maximum of a differentiable $f$, $f'(x) = 0$; such points are **critical points**. A global optimum on an interval is a critical point or an endpoint (or a limit at an open end), so list the candidates and compare their values. The second derivative classifies a critical point: $f'' > 0$ is a local minimum, $f'' < 0$ a local maximum. Gradient descent (`M10.1`) finds the same points numerically when solving $f' = 0$ by hand is impossible.

### 2.5 Integrals and the fundamental theorem

The definite integral $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$ is the limit of **Riemann sums** $\sum_i f(x_i)\,\Delta x$ over finer and finer partitions. The **fundamental theorem of calculus** (FTC) connects it to derivatives in two ways: if $F' = f$ then $\int_a^b f = F(b) - F(a)$; and $\frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t)\,dt = f(x)$ for continuous $f$. With a variable upper limit $u(x)$, the chain rule adds a factor: $\frac{d}{dx} \int_a^{u(x)} f(t)\,dt = f(u(x))\,u'(x)$. The **average value** of $f$ on $[a, b]$ is $\frac{1}{b - a}\int_a^b f$.

### 2.6 L'Hôpital's rule

If $f(x) \to 0$ and $g(x) \to 0$ (or both $\to \pm\infty$) as $x \to a$, and $\lim f'(x)/g'(x)$ **exists**, then $\lim f(x)/g(x)$ equals it. It may need several applications ($\frac{e^x - 1 - x}{x^2}$ takes two). Products $0 \cdot \infty$ become quotients, and powers $0^0$ or $1^\infty$ become products after taking the logarithm. When the limit of $f'/g'$ does not exist, the rule says nothing, and the original limit may still exist (q57).

## 3. Worked example by hand

This is a sibling of q13 and q38, not one of the graded problems.

**A chain rule derivative.** Differentiate $f(x) = \ln(1 + e^{-x})$. Outer function $\ln u$ with derivative $1/u$; inner $u = 1 + e^{-x}$ with derivative $-e^{-x}$ (chain rule again, inner $-x$). So $f'(x) = \frac{-e^{-x}}{1 + e^{-x}}$. Multiply top and bottom by $e^{x}$: $f'(x) = \frac{-1}{e^x + 1} = -\sigma(-x)$. This is the derivative of the binary cross-entropy for a positive label, written in terms of the logit. In `solve/` it would be `answer = "-exp(-x)/(1 + exp(-x))"`; `answer = "-1/(exp(x) + 1)"` passes too, because SymPy checks equivalence, and `answer = "1/(1 + exp(-x))"` fails.

**An optimization.** Maximize $g(s) = s(10 - 2s)^2$ for $0 \le s \le 5$ (an open box from a $10 \times 10$ sheet). $g'(s) = (10 - 2s)^2 + s \cdot 2(10 - 2s)(-2) = (10 - 2s)(10 - 2s - 4s) = (10 - 2s)(10 - 6s)$. The critical points are $s = 5$ (a zero-volume box) and $s = 5/3$. Compare candidates: $g(0) = 0$, $g(5) = 0$, $g(5/3) = \frac{5}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2000}{27}$. The maximizer is $s = 5/3$.

## 4. The problem set

Write each answer in `solve/S-M01.toml`:

```toml
[q1]
answer = "4"
[q13]
answer = "exp(-z)/(1 + exp(-z))^2"
[q35]
answer = "{-1, 1}"
[q10]
proof = "S-M01/q10.md"
```

Numbers are exact: `exp(2)`, `2/pi`, `sqrt(7)/2`; `0.5` fails where `1/2` is expected. An `[expr]` answer may take any equivalent form. Write $e$ as `E` or `exp(1)` and $\pi$ as `pi`.
