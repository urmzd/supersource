## Key Takeaways

- The relative condition number $\kappa_f(x) = \lvert x f'(x) / f(x)\rvert$ and the matrix condition number $\kappa_2(A) = \sigma_{\max}/\sigma_{\min}$ say how much the problem amplifies input errors, whatever the algorithm (q1 to q6).
- Every rounding multiplies by $(1 + \delta)$, $\lvert\delta\rvert \le u$, and $k$ of them stay within $\gamma_k = ku/(1 - ku)$; pairwise summation cuts $k$ to $\log_2 k$, and random signs typically give $\sqrt{k}\,u$ (q7 to q12).
- Fixed-point iteration converges linearly at the rate $\lvert g'(x^*)\rvert$; Newton converges quadratically at a simple root, so the correct digits double each step (q13 to q17).
- `expf` reduces $x$ to $r \in [-\ln 2/2, \ln 2/2]$ and evaluates a short polynomial; the Lagrange remainder fixes the degree, and Chebyshev nodes minimize the interpolation error's node product (q18 to q23).
- fp8 and MX formats are the same rounding with few bits: E4M3 has precision $2^{-4}$ and range to 448, E5M2 trades a bit of precision for range to 57344, and an MX block scale is the power of two that puts the block's maximum in the top binade (q24 to q28).

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start S-M09b             # writes solve/S-M09b.toml and the proof files
ss check S-M09b             # SymPy checks the answers, then asks each proof rubric (y/n)
ss check S-M09b --regrade   # ask the rubrics again after you change a proof
```

## 1. Why now

Part 8 compares numbers that should agree but were computed differently: your sampler's float64 sums against the Rust engine's, a quantized matmul against float32, a float16 KV cache against a float32 one. Part 9 then writes `rsqrt` by Newton's method and `expf` by range reduction and a polynomial, in C, and must prove them accurate to a few ulps. `M09.3` and `M09.4` turn the bounds and the formats into code; this set makes you derive them by hand first, so a failing tolerance or a kernel that is off by one ulp is something you can explain rather than tune.

## 2. Principles

|---|---|---|
| $u = 2^{-p}$ | unit roundoff, $p$ significand bits with the implicit 1 | float |

| $\kappa_f(x) = \lvert x f'(x)/f(x)\rvert$ | relative condition number of $f$ at $x$ | float |
| $\kappa_2(A) = \sigma_{\max}/\sigma_{\min}$ | 2-norm condition number | float |
| $g$, $x^*$ | an iteration map $x_{k+1} = g(x_k)$ and its fixed point $g(x^*) = x^*$ | function, float |
| $e_k$ | the error after $k$ steps | float |
| $T_n$ | the Chebyshev polynomial of degree $n$, $T_n(\cos\theta) = \cos n\theta$ | polynomial |
| $X$ | an MX block scale, a power of two | float |

### 2.1 Conditioning

A relative change $\epsilon$ in the input changes the output of $f$ by about $\kappa_f(x)\,\epsilon$ (first-order Taylor). For $Ax = b$, $\lVert\delta x\rVert/\lVert x\rVert \le \kappa_2(A)\, \lVert\delta b\rVert/\lVert b\rVert$, with $\lVert A\rVert_2 = \sigma_{\max}$ and $\lVert A^{-1}\rVert_2 = 1/\sigma_{\min}$. The singular values of $A$ are the square roots of the eigenvalues of $A^\top A$, not the eigenvalues of $A$ (they coincide only for symmetric positive semidefinite $A$).

### 2.2 Error bounds

Under $\mathrm{fl}(a \circ b) = (a \circ b)(1 + \delta)$, $\lvert\delta\rvert \le u$, a dot product of length $k$ in any order satisfies $\lvert\mathrm{fl}(x^\top y) - x^\top y\rvert \le \gamma_k\, \lvert x\rvert^\top\lvert y\rvert$. To first order $\gamma_k \approx ku$. A balanced (pairwise) tree puts each term through $\lceil\log_2 k\rceil$ additions instead of up to $k - 1$. Rounding errors with independent random signs add like a random walk, so the typical error is about $\sqrt{k}\,u$; the worst case is $ku$.

### 2.3 Iterations

If $g$ is differentiable near a fixed point $x^*$, then $e_{k+1} = g(x_k) - g(x^*) \approx g'(x^*)\, e_k$: linear convergence with rate $\lvert g'(x^*)\rvert$ when it is below 1. Newton's iteration for a root of $f$ is $g(x) = x - f(x)/f'(x)$; at a simple root $g'(x^*) = 0$ and $e_{k+1} \approx \tfrac{g''(x^*)}{2} e_k^2$: quadratic. At a double root $f'(x^*) = 0$ too and the rate degrades to linear.

### 2.4 Polynomial approximation

Taylor's theorem with the Lagrange remainder: $e^r = \sum_{j=0}^{n} r^j/j! + R_n$ with $\lvert R_n\rvert \le e^{\lvert r\rvert}\lvert r\rvert^{n+1}/(n+1)!$. Range reduction $x = k\ln 2 + r$, $k = \mathrm{round}(x/\ln 2)$, keeps $\lvert r\rvert \le \ln 2/2$, so a short polynomial suffices, and $e^x = 2^k e^r$ is an exponent adjustment. Horner's rule $a_0 + r(a_1 + r(a_2 + \dots))$ uses $n$ multiplications for degree $n$. Interpolating at $n + 1$ nodes leaves an error proportional to $\prod_i (x - x_i)$; the Chebyshev nodes (zeros of $T_{n+1}$) make that product the monic $T_{n+1}/2^n$, whose maximum on $[-1, 1]$ is $2^{-n}$, the smallest possible.

### 2.5 Low precision

A format with $M$ fraction bits and bias $B$ has quantum $2^{\max(\lfloor\log_2 v\rfloor, 1 - B) - M}$ near $v$; rounding is to the nearest multiple, ties to the even significand. E4M3 ($M = 3$, $B = 7$, max 448), E5M2 ($M = 2$, $B = 15$, max 57344, top exponent reserved), FP4 E2M1 (values 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6). An MX block scale is $X = 2^{\lfloor\log_2 a_{\max}\rfloor - e_{\max}}$, with $e_{\max}$ the exponent of the element format's largest normal.

## 3. Worked example by hand

These are siblings of q1, q14, and q24, not graded problems.

**Conditioning of $\sqrt{x}$.** $f'(x) = 1/(2\sqrt{x})$, so $\kappa = \lvert x \cdot \tfrac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} / \sqrt{x}\rvert = \tfrac12$ for every $x > 0$: square roots halve relative errors.

**One Newton step for $1/\sqrt{a}$.** With $a = 2$ and $y_0 = 0.7$: $y_1 = 0.7\,(3 - 2 \cdot 0.49)/2 = 0.7 \cdot 2.02/2 = 0.707$. The relative error drops from $1 - \sqrt{2} \cdot 0.7 = 0.01005$ to $1 - \sqrt{2}\cdot 0.707 = 0.000151$, close to $\tfrac32 (0.01005)^2 = 0.000152$: quadratic.

**2.75 to E4M3.** $\lfloor\log_2 2.75\rfloor = 1$, quantum $2^{1-3} = 0.25$, $2.75/0.25 = 11$ exactly: value 2.75, code $((-2 + 3 + 7 - 1) \ll 3) + 11 = 56 + 11 = 67$. Decode: $e_f = 8$, $f = 3$, $(8 + 3)\cdot 2^{8 - 7 - 3} = 2.75$.

## 4. The problem set

Write each answer in `solve/S-M09b.toml`; lettered parts are their own tables:

```toml
[q1]
answer = "1001"
[q7]
answer = "3/(2^24 - 3)"
[q16.b]
answer = "1/2"
[q6]
proof = "S-M09b/q6.md"
```

Give exact values as integers, fractions, powers of two, or expressions in `log`; only q13 accepts a decimal, within a relative tolerance of $10^{-6}$.

**q6.** Prove that if $Ax = b$ and $A(x + \delta x) = b + \delta b$ with $A$ invertible and $b \ne 0$, then $\lVert\delta x\rVert/\lVert x\rVert \le \kappa_2(A)\, \lVert\delta b\rVert/\lVert b\rVert$ in the 2-norm. `[proof]`

### Sum and dot error bounds

**q7.** Give $\gamma_3$ for float32 exactly. `[number]`

**q9.** The same dot product with the sum done pairwise: give the first-order bound $(\lceil \log_2 k\rceil + 1)\, u$ (one rounding per product, one per tree level). `[number]`

**q10.** In bf16, give the smallest $k$ for which $k u \ge 1$, where the bound $\gamma_k$ says nothing. `[number]`

**q11.** The statistical rule of thumb replaces $k u$ by $\sqrt{k}\, u$ (errors with random signs add like a random walk). Give it for float32 and $k = 4096$. `[number]`

**q12.** Prove that recursive summation of three numbers satisfies $\lvert \mathrm{fl}(\mathrm{fl}(x_1 + x_2) + x_3) - (x_1 + x_2 + x_3)\rvert \le \gamma_2 (\lvert x_1\rvert + \lvert x_2\rvert + \lvert x_3\rvert)$ under the model $\mathrm{fl}(a + b) = (a + b)(1 + \delta)$, $\lvert\delta\rvert \le u$. `[proof]`

### Fixed point and Newton convergence

**q13.** The iteration $x_{k+1} = \cos x_k$ converges to the fixed point $x^* \approx 0.739085$. Give its asymptotic linear rate $\lvert g'(x^*)\rvert = \sin x^*$ to at least 7 significant digits. `[number, rtol 1e-6]`

**q14.** Newton's method for $f(y) = 1/y^2 - a$ gives $y_{k+1} = y_k (3 - a y_k^2)/2$, the update `M09.5` uses for `rsqrt`. With $a = 4$ and $y_0 = 0.4$, give $y_1$ exactly. `[number]`

**q15.** Let $e_k = 1 - \sqrt{a}\, y_k$ be the relative error of that iteration. Using the identity of q17, give $e_1$ exactly when $e_0 = 2^{-4}$. `[number]`

**q16.** (a) Give the order of convergence of Newton's method at a simple root. (b) At a double root Newton converges only linearly; give the rate (the ratio $e_{k+1}/e_k$ in the limit). `[number]`

**q17.** Prove that the iteration of q14 satisfies $e_{k+1} = (3 e_k^2 - e_k^3)/2$, and conclude that it converges quadratically. `[proof]`

### Polynomial approximation

**q18.** `expf` reduces $x = k \ln 2 + r$ with $k = \mathrm{round}(x / \ln 2)$, so $e^x = 2^k e^r$. Give $r$ for $x = 10$, exactly. `[number]`

**q19.** Give the half-width of the interval the reduced argument $r$ lies in. `[number]`

**q20.** On $\lvert r\rvert \le \ln 2 / 2$, the Taylor polynomial of $e^r$ of degree $n$ has the Lagrange bound $e^{\ln 2/2} (\ln 2/2)^{n+1}/(n+1)!$. Give the smallest $n$ for which it is below $2^{-24}$. `[number]`

**q23.** Give $\max_{x \in [-1, 1]} \lvert (x - x_0)(x - x_1)(x - x_2)\rvert$ for those three nodes. `[number]`
