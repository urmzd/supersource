## Key Takeaways

- $\log\sum_i e^{x_i} = m + \log\sum_i e^{x_i - m}$ with $m = \max_i x_i$: after the shift the largest exponential is $e^0 = 1$, so nothing overflows, and the answer is finite for logits of any size (`test_no_overflow`, `test_shift_invariance`).
- `log_softmax` is `x - logsumexp(x)`, never `log(softmax(x))`: the second takes the log of an underflowed 0 and returns $-\infty$ where the answer is $-10^4$ (`test_no_underflow_in_log_softmax`).
- A fully masked row (all $-\infty$) is defined, not NaN: softmax gives zeros, log-sum-exp and log-softmax give $-\infty$ (`test_fully_masked_row`).
- Plain summation of $n$ floats can be off by about $n u \sum|x_i|$; pairwise summation cuts that to $\lceil\log_2 n\rceil u \sum|x_i|$ and Kahan's compensation to about $2u|S|$, independent of $n$ (`test_kahan_error_bound`, `test_pairwise_error_bound`).

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start M09.2              # stubs stable.py into your repo, contract alongside
ss tests M09.2              # read the test catalog first: rung R0, you write no tests here
ss check M09.2              # exit code is the verdict
ss diff  M09.2              # after passing: your code against the reference
```

## 1. Why now

Your tracer bigram (`L0.0`) already hides a numerically careful softmax: its `nll` subtracts each row's maximum before `exp`. In this pass that one line becomes a dozen call sites. Your autograd op library (`L0.2`) needs softmax and log-softmax as ops, the fused cross-entropy (`L0.3`) needs log-softmax at the target, the sampler (`L8.1`) turns temperature-scaled logits into probabilities, and the model zoo (`L6.7`) sums ten million per-token losses into one perplexity. Written the obvious way, each of them fails the first time training succeeds: a confident model produces a logit above 88.7, `np.exp` overflows float32 to `inf`, and the loss becomes `inf / inf = nan`; a confidently wrong token gets probability $e^{-200} = 0$ in float32, and `log(0)` is an infinite loss with a NaN gradient. This module writes the stable versions once, proves them, and makes every later module import them.

## 2. Principles

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ | one row of logits (scores) | `float[n]` |
| $m = \max_i x_i$ | the shift that prevents overflow | scalar |
| $\mathrm{LSE}(x) = \log\sum_i e^{x_i}$ | log-sum-exp | scalar |
| $\mathrm{softmax}(x)_i = e^{x_i} / \sum_j e^{x_j}$ | probabilities from logits | `float[n]`, sums to 1 |
| $\mathrm{logsoftmax}(x)_i = x_i - \mathrm{LSE}(x)$ | log-probabilities from logits | `float[n]` |
| $u$ | unit roundoff: $2^{-24} \approx 6.0 \times 10^{-8}$ for float32, $2^{-53} \approx 1.1 \times 10^{-16}$ for float64 | scalar |
| $\mathrm{fl}(a \circ b)$ | the floating-point result of an operation $\circ$ | scalar |
| $S = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ | the exact sum | scalar |
| $\hat S$ | the computed sum | scalar |
| $c$ | Kahan's compensation: the low-order part lost so far | scalar |

**Where exp breaks.** `M09.1` showed that the largest float32 is about $3.4 \times 10^{38} = e^{88.72}$ and the largest float64 about $e^{709.78}$. So `np.exp(89.0)` in float32 is `inf`. At the other end, $e^x$ underflows to exactly 0 below about $-103.9$ in float32 (counting subnormals) and $-745.1$ in float64. Logits after training routinely exceed 100 in magnitude, and masks write $-\infty$ on purpose.

**The shift identity.** For any constant $c$, $\sum_i e^{x_i} = e^{c} \sum_i e^{x_i - c}$, so

$$\mathrm{LSE}(x) = c + \log \sum_i e^{x_i - c}.$$

Choose $c = m = \max_i x_i$. Every shifted exponent $x_i - m$ is at most 0, so every term is at most 1, and the largest term is exactly $e^0 = 1$. The sum lies in $[1, n]$: it cannot overflow, it is never 0, and its log lies in $[0, \log n]$. Nothing is lost by the shift, because the identity is exact.

**Softmax is shift invariant.** Dividing by the sum cancels the factor $e^{c}$:

$$\mathrm{softmax}(x + c)_i = \frac{e^{x_i + c}}{\sum_j e^{x_j + c}} = \frac{e^{c} e^{x_i}}{e^{c} \sum_j e^{x_j}} = \mathrm{softmax}(x)_i.$$

So compute $e^{x_i - m} / \sum_j e^{x_j - m}$. The same identity lets the C kernel in `L9.2` process a row in one pass: when a new maximum $m'$ appears, it rescales the running sum by $e^{m - m'}$ instead of starting over.

**Log-softmax from the identity, not from softmax.** $\log \mathrm{softmax}(x)_i = x_i - \mathrm{LSE}(x)$. Computed this way it is a subtraction of two moderate numbers. Computed as `log(softmax(x))`, it first rounds $e^{x_i - m}$, which underflows to 0 once $x_i - m < -104$ in float32, and then takes `log(0) = -inf`. The cross-entropy loss is $-\mathrm{logsoftmax}(x)_t$ at the target $t$, so this is the difference between a large finite loss (with a useful gradient) and an infinite one.

**Masks.** A masked entry is $x_i = -\infty$, so $e^{x_i - m} = 0$ and it gets probability exactly 0. If every entry is masked, $m = -\infty$ and $x_i - m = -\infty - (-\infty)$ is NaN. The contract defines that row instead of propagating NaN: replace a non-finite $m$ by 0, so the shifted entries stay $-\infty$, the sum is 0, softmax returns zeros (divide by 1 when the sum is 0), and log-sum-exp returns $\log 0 = -\infty$. A padded position in a batch is exactly such a row.

**Rounding in a sum.** Every floating addition rounds: $\mathrm{fl}(a + b) = (a + b)(1 + \delta)$ with $|\delta| \le u$. Summing left to right, the $k$-th partial sum carries the rounding errors of all earlier additions, and the first terms pass through $n - 1$ additions. The standard bound is

$$|\hat S - S| \le (n - 1)\, u \sum_i |x_i| + O(u^2).$$

For $n = 10^7$ float32 values that is a relative error up to about $0.6$: useless. In practice errors partly cancel, but when the addends have the same sign (losses, counts, probabilities) they accumulate.

**Pairwise summation.** Split the array in halves, sum each half the same way, add the two results. The recursion is $\lceil \log_2 n \rceil$ levels deep, and each element takes part in only one addition per level, so

$$|\hat S - S| \le \lceil \log_2 n \rceil\, u \sum_i |x_i| + O(u^2).$$

For $n = 10^7$ that is 24 instead of $10^7$. numpy's `np.sum` does this internally (with blocks of 8 at the leaves), which is why the tests use `np.cumsum`, a strictly sequential sum, to show the problem.

**Kahan's compensated summation.** Keep a second variable $c$ holding the part the running sum $s$ could not absorb. For each $x$:

$$y = x - c, \qquad t = s + y, \qquad c = (t - s) - y, \qquad s = t.$$

When $|s| \ge |y|$, $t - s$ is computed exactly, and it is the part of $y$ that actually made it into $t$; subtracting $y$ leaves minus the part that was rounded away. Algebraically $c = 0$, which is the point: in floating point it is the rounding error, recovered exactly and fed back into the next addend. The error bound becomes

$$|\hat S - S| \le 2u|S| + O(n u^2) \sum_i |x_i|,$$

which no longer grows with $n$ to first order. It costs four operations per element and a sequential loop, so it is used where the count is huge and the budget is not: running totals of losses, token counts, and perplexity.

**Work in the input's dtype.** The point of compensation is to get extra precision without a wider type. Both sums here keep every operation in the dtype of $x$ (float32 stays float32) and return a Python float.

## 3. Worked example by hand

**Log-sum-exp and softmax of $x = [1, 2, 3]$.**

| step | values |
|---|---|
| $m = \max x$ | 3 |
| $x - m$ | $[-2, -1, 0]$ |
| $e^{x - m}$ | $[0.135335, 0.367879, 1]$ |
| sum | $1.503215$ |
| $\log$ sum | $0.407606$ |
| $\mathrm{LSE} = m + \log$ sum | $3.407606$ |
| softmax $= e^{x-m} / $ sum | $[0.090031, 0.244728, 0.665241]$ |
| log-softmax $= x - \mathrm{LSE}$ | $[-2.407606, -1.407606, -0.407606]$ |

The softmax row sums to 1, and $e^{-0.407606} = 0.665241$ confirms the last entry. Adding 1000 to every entry changes $m$ to 1003 and leaves every shifted value, and so the softmax, unchanged.

**A masked row** $[0, -\infty, 0]$: $m = 0$, shifted $[0, -\infty, 0]$, exponentials $[1, 0, 1]$, softmax $[0.5, 0, 0.5]$, log-softmax $[-\ln 2, -\infty, -\ln 2]$. **A fully masked row** $[-\infty, -\infty, -\infty]$: $m$ becomes 0, every exponential is 0, softmax is $[0, 0, 0]$, and log-sum-exp is $-\infty$.

**Summing $[2^{24}, 1, 1, -2^{24}]$ in float32.** At $2^{24} = 16777216$ consecutive float32 values are 2 apart, so $2^{24} + 1 = 16777217$ is exactly halfway between two floats and rounds to the even one, $16777216$. The exact sum is 2.

- Left to right: $2^{24} + 1 \to 2^{24}$, $+ 1 \to 2^{24}$, $- 2^{24} \to 0$. Both ones are lost.
- Pairwise: $(2^{24} + 1) + (1 - 2^{24}) = 16777216 + (-16777215) = 1$. The left pair loses its 1; $1 - 2^{24} = -16777215$ is representable, so the right pair keeps its 1. Better, not exact.
- Kahan, one row per element:

| $x$ | $y = x - c$ | $t = s + y$ | $c = (t - s) - y$ | $s$ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $2^{24}$ | $2^{24}$ | $2^{24}$ | 0 | $2^{24}$ |
| 1 | 1 | $2^{24}$ (rounded) | $(2^{24} - 2^{24}) - 1 = -1$ | $2^{24}$ |
| 1 | $1 - (-1) = 2$ | $2^{24} + 2$ (exact) | $2 - 2 = 0$ | $2^{24} + 2$ |
| $-2^{24}$ | $-2^{24}$ | 2 | $(2 - (2^{24} + 2)) + 2^{24} = 0$ | 2 |

The second row is the whole idea: the 1 that rounding threw away reappears as $c = -1$, and the next step adds it back. Kahan returns the exact 2.

In float64 the same thing happens one scale up: at $10^{16}$ floats are 2 apart, so plain summation of $[10^{16}, 1, 1, -10^{16}]$ gives 0. Pairwise also gives 0 there, because $1 - 10^{16}$ is a tie too and rounds back to $-10^{16}$; Kahan gives 2.

These numbers are the first cases in section 4: `test_hand_example`, `test_hand_example_sums`, and `test_sums_work_in_the_input_dtype`.

## 4. The interface

```python
# python/tinyllm/num/stable.py
def logsumexp(x: ArrayLike, axis: int = -1, keepdims: bool = False) -> NDArray
def softmax(x: ArrayLike, axis: int = -1) -> NDArray
def log_softmax(x: ArrayLike, axis: int = -1) -> NDArray
def kahan_sum(x: ArrayLike) -> float
def pairwise_sum(x: ArrayLike) -> float
```

Float inputs keep their dtype; integer inputs are computed in float64. `axis` and `keepdims` mean what they mean in numpy. The sums flatten their input in C order. `pairwise_sum` splits at `h = n // 2` down to single elements; pairing neighbours bottom up builds the same tree when $n$ is a power of two, so a vectorized version is fine. The contract has the full rules.

### What the tests check

| Test | KIND | Checks | Why it matters downstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test_hand_example` | unit | the section 3 table for $[1, 2, 3]$ | you and the test agree on the definitions |
| `test_hand_example_sums` | unit | float32 $[2^{24}, 1, 1, -2^{24}]$: plain 0, Kahan 2, pairwise 1 | the three sums differ exactly as derived |
| `test_matches_scipy_golden` | golden | scipy's three functions on seven shapes, axes, and scales | an independent implementation agrees |
| `test_shift_invariance` | property | adding $c \in [-1000, 1000]$ changes nothing but LSE by $c$ | the online softmax of `L9.2` rescales a running sum |
| `test_no_overflow` | boundary | $[1000, 1000]$ gives $[0.5, 0.5]$; $\pm 10^4$ stays finite | logits after training |
| `test_no_underflow_in_log_softmax` | boundary | $[0, -10^4]$ gives $[0, -10^4]$, not $-\infty$ | the cross-entropy of `L0.3` |
| `test_fully_masked_row` | boundary | all $-\infty$ gives zeros and $-\infty$, no NaN, no warning | padded rows in a batch |
| `test_axis_and_keepdims` | unit | every axis of a 3-D array, keepdims shapes | attention over `[B, H, T, T]` |
| `test_dtype_preserved` | unit | float32 in, float32 out; integers become float64 | kernels compare in float32 |
| `test_softmax_rows_sum_to_one` | property | rows of scale 0.1 to 700 sum to 1 | the sampler's CDF ends at 1 |
| `test_kahan_error_bound` | property | 65536 float32 values within $2u\lvert S\rvert$; plain summation is not | `L6.7` sums $10^7$ losses |
| `test_pairwise_error_bound` | property | within $\lceil\log_2 n\rceil u \sum \lvert x\rvert$ for $n = 65536$ and $50001$ | the cheap accurate sum |
| `test_sums_cover_every_element` | boundary | lengths 0, 1, odd, a 2-D array, integers | no dropped or invented term |
| `test_sums_work_in_the_input_dtype` | unit | the float64 version of the hand example | compensation, not a wider type, does the work |

## 5. Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Caught by |
|---|---|---|
| 1. exponentiating before subtracting the max | `inf / inf = nan` at a float32 logit of 89 | `test_no_overflow` (mutant `s01`) |
| 2. `log(softmax(x))` | $-\infty$ log-probability, infinite loss, NaN gradient | `test_no_underflow_in_log_softmax` (mutant `s02`) |
| 3. subtracting a max of $-\infty$, or dividing by a zero sum | a padded row of NaN that spreads through the batch | `test_fully_masked_row` (mutants `s03`, `s04`, `s14`) |
| 4. computing the compensation and never using it | Kahan silently becomes plain summation | `test_kahan_error_bound` (mutants `s06`, `s07`) |
| 5. a "pairwise" recursion that peels off one element at a time | a depth-$n$ tree, the sequential error, and a recursion limit | `test_pairwise_error_bound` (mutant `s09`) |
| 6. forgetting to add $m$ back in log-sum-exp | off by exactly the row maximum | `test_hand_example` (mutant `s05`) |
| 7. dropping the middle element of an odd split, or indexing an empty array | off by a whole term | `test_sums_cover_every_element` (mutants `s08`, `s10`) |
| 8. reducing the wrong axis, ignoring `keepdims` | attention normalized over the batch | `test_axis_and_keepdims` (mutants `s11`, `s12`) |
| 9. upcasting float32 to float64 | the C kernel's float32 reference no longer matches | `test_dtype_preserved` (mutant `s13`) |

## 6. Where it's used next

| Direction | Module | How it uses this |
|---|---|---|
| Back | `M09.1` | the overflow and underflow thresholds of `exp`, and the unit roundoff $u$ in every bound |
| Back | `M02.1` | Taylor's view of $e^x$ near 0, behind why small shifted exponents are accurate |
| Forward | `M11.1` | `entropy_from_logits` uses `log_softmax` |
| Forward | `M08.3` | `cross_entropy_vjp` uses `softmax` |
| Forward | `L0.2` | softmax and log-softmax become autograd ops |
| Forward | `L0.3` | the fused cross-entropy is $-\mathrm{logsoftmax}$ at the target |
| Forward | `L8.1` | temperature-scaled logits to sampling probabilities |
| Forward | `L6.7` | perplexity over $10^7$ tokens accumulates with `kahan_sum` (through `M11.2`) |
| Forward | `L9.2` | the same math in C, in one pass with a running maximum |

If you skip this module, `ss check M11.1` stops with `M11.1 needs M09.2`: build it, or rerun with `--ref-deps`.
