## Key Takeaways

- **Logistic regression** models $P(y = 1 \mid x) = \sigma(w \cdot x)$; its loss is convex, so the minimum is where the gradient $X^\top(p - y) + \lambda w$ vanishes (`test_fit_is_a_stationary_point`).
- **Newton's method** on that loss is IRLS: each step is one linear solve with the Hessian $X^\top S X + \lambda I$, $S = \operatorname{diag}(p(1-p))$, and the digits double per step (`test_hand_example_newton_step`, `test_newton_converges_quadratically`).
- The **ROC curve** sweeps every threshold; its area, the **AUC**, is the probability a random positive outscores a random negative, ties counting half (`test_hand_example_roc_auc`, `test_auc_is_mann_whitney`).
- **Calibration** asks whether "0.8" means right 80% of the time; the **ECE** is the count-weighted gap between confidence and accuracy over bins (`test_hand_example_ece`, `test_ece_calibrated_vs_overconfident`).
- A ranking metric and a calibration metric answer different questions: sharpening probabilities leaves the AUC unchanged and wrecks the ECE.

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start M07.7              # stubs metrics.py into your repo
ss tests M07.7              # read the test catalog first: rung R0, you write no tests here
ss check M07.7              # exit code is the verdict
ss check M07.7 --ref-deps   # only if you skipped M03.2 or M01.4
ss diff  M07.7              # after passing: your code against the reference
```

## 1. Why now

Pass 5 gives your system its first classifiers. `L6.5` puts a classification head on BERT and ELECTRA, and the gateway's usage policy (D33) is a linear head over your engine's embeddings: a dot product and a sigmoid that Go evaluates on every request. That head has to be fitted, and gradient descent with a learning rate to tune is the wrong tool for a convex problem with a few hundred weights: Newton's method solves it in five or six steps, each step a linear system you already know how to solve (`M03.2`). Once fitted, the head needs two numbers before anyone trusts it. Does it rank unsafe requests above safe ones (AUC)? And when it says 0.9, is it right 90% of the time, so a threshold of 0.9 means what the operator thinks (ECE)? This module builds the fitter and both metrics.

## 2. Principles

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $X$ | feature matrix, one row per example | `float64[n, d]` |
| $X_a$ | $X$ with a column of ones appended (the intercept column, last) | `float64[n, d+1]` |
| $y_i \in \{0, 1\}$ | labels | `float64[n]` |
| $w$ | weights; with an intercept, $w_{d}$ (the last) is the bias $b$ | `float64[d+1]` |
| $z_i = x_i \cdot w$ | the logit (log-odds) of example $i$ | `float64[n]` |
| $\sigma(z) = 1/(1 + e^{-z})$ | the sigmoid | |
| $p_i = \sigma(z_i)$ | predicted $P(y_i = 1)$ | `float64[n]` |
| $\lambda$ (`l2`) | ridge penalty on the feature weights | `float` $\ge 0$ |
| $g$, $H$ | gradient and Hessian of the loss | `[d+1]`, `[d+1, d+1]` |
| $S$ | $\operatorname{diag}(p_i (1 - p_i))$ | `[n, n]` (never formed) |
| TPR, FPR | true and false positive rates at a threshold | |
| $B$ (`n_bins`) | number of confidence bins | `int` |

### 2.1 The model and its loss

A linear score $z = w \cdot x$ can be any real number; a probability must lie in $(0, 1)$. The sigmoid maps one to the other, and its inverse is the log-odds: $z = \log \frac{p}{1 - p}$. So logistic regression says the log-odds are linear in the features; a unit step in feature $j$ multiplies the odds by $e^{w_j}$. Fitting maximizes the likelihood $\prod_i p_i^{y_i}(1 - p_i)^{1 - y_i}$, or equivalently minimizes

$$L(w) = -\sum_i \bigl[y_i \log p_i + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - p_i)\bigr] + \tfrac{\lambda}{2}\lVert w_{\text{feat}} \rVert^2 .$$

The derivative of the bracket with respect to $z_i$ is just $p_i - y_i$ (because $\sigma' = \sigma(1 - \sigma)$; `S-M07d` q7 asks for it), so by the chain rule $g = X_a^\top (p - y) + \lambda w_{\text{feat}}$. Differentiating once more, $H = X_a^\top S X_a + \lambda I_{\text{feat}}$. For any vector $v$, $v^\top H v = \sum_i p_i(1 - p_i)(x_i \cdot v)^2 + \lambda \lVert v_{\text{feat}} \rVert^2 \ge 0$: the loss is **convex**, every stationary point is the global minimum (the proof is `S-M07d` q9). With an intercept, the intercept row of $g = 0$ reads $\sum_i (p_i - y_i) = 0$: the fitted probabilities average to the base rate.

### 2.2 Fitting by Newton's method

`M01.2` found a root of $f$ by $x \leftarrow x - f(x)/f'(x)$. Minimizing $L$ is finding a root of its gradient, so the step is $w \leftarrow w - H^{-1} g$: solve $H \delta = g$ (one `lu` and one `lu_solve`) and subtract. Expanding $w - H^{-1}g$ shows each step is a weighted least-squares solve with weights $p_i(1 - p_i)$ that change every iteration, hence **iteratively reweighted least squares**. Near the optimum Newton converges **quadratically**: the error is roughly squared each step, so $10^{-2}$ becomes $10^{-4}$, then $10^{-8}$, then rounding. Five or six steps from $w = 0$ are typical; the reference stops once a step is below $10^{-12}$ relative. Without a penalty and with perfectly separable data there is no finite minimum (the weights grow forever), which is one reason the head is always fitted with $\lambda > 0$.

The sigmoid needs care: $e^{-z}$ overflows for $z < -709$ and $e^{z}/(1 + e^{z})$ is $\infty/\infty$ for $z > 709$. Computing $e^{-|z|}$, which is at most 1, and choosing the formula by the sign of $z$ is exact everywhere.

### 2.3 Regularization

The penalty $\frac{\lambda}{2}\lVert w_{\text{feat}} \rVert^2$ pulls feature weights toward 0; it adds $\lambda$ to the Hessian diagonal, which also makes $H$ safely invertible. The **intercept is not penalized**: shrinking it toward 0 would bias every probability toward 0.5 instead of toward the base rate. With $\lambda \to \infty$ the features are switched off and $\sigma(b)$ becomes the fraction of positives. This is scikit-learn's convention with $C = 1/\lambda$.

### 2.4 The ROC curve

A threshold $t$ turns scores into decisions: say 1 when score $\ge t$. Then TPR $= \#\{\text{positives} \ge t\}/P$ and FPR $= \#\{\text{negatives} \ge t\}/N$. Lowering $t$ from $+\infty$ to below the smallest score walks from $(0, 0)$ to $(1, 1)$: each positive passed is a step up, each negative a step right. That staircase is the **ROC curve**, one corner per distinct score. Several examples with the **same score** cannot be separated by any threshold, so they enter together: a diagonal step. Stepping through them one at a time would make the curve depend on the order of the input.

### 2.5 AUC is a ranking probability

The area under the staircase, `trapezoid(tpr, fpr)` from `M01.4`, has a meaning: each up-step at horizontal position FPR contributes the fraction of negatives already below that positive. Summed, the AUC is the fraction of (positive, negative) pairs in which the positive scores higher, a tie counting $\frac{1}{2}$ (the diagonal step's triangle). That is the Mann-Whitney $U$ statistic divided by $PN$. Consequences: AUC ignores the scores' scale (any increasing transform leaves it unchanged), flipping the labels gives $1 - \text{AUC}$, random scores give 0.5.

### 2.6 Calibration and ECE

A classifier is **calibrated** if, among the predictions made with confidence $c$, a fraction $c$ is correct. Group the predictions into $B$ equal-width bins of confidence, $(b/B, (b + 1)/B]$, and compare each bin's mean confidence with its accuracy: plotted, that is the reliability diagram. The **expected calibration error** is the count-weighted mean gap:

$$\text{ECE} = \sum_{b} \frac{n_b}{n}\,\lvert \text{acc}_b - \text{conf}_b \rvert .$$

For a binary probability $p$ the prediction is 1 when $p \ge 0.5$ and the confidence is $\max(p, 1 - p)$; with class probabilities, the top class and its probability (the "top-label" ECE of Guo et al.). Even a perfectly calibrated classifier has an ECE of a few hundredths from sampling noise in each bin, which is why the test compares calibrated against overconfident rather than against 0.

## 3. Worked example by hand

**One Newton step.** One feature, no intercept: $x = (1, -1)$, $y = (1, 0)$, $\lambda = 1$. At $w = 0$ both $p_i = \frac{1}{2}$.

| Quantity | Computation | Value |
|---|---|---|
| $g$ | $(\tfrac12 - 1)(1) + (\tfrac12 - 0)(-1) + 1 \cdot 0$ | $-1$ |
| $H$ | $\tfrac14 \cdot 1 + \tfrac14 \cdot 1 + 1$ | $\tfrac32$ |
| $w_1$ | $0 - (-1)/\tfrac32$ | $\tfrac23$ |

The optimum satisfies $g = 0$: $2(1 - \sigma(w)) = w$, so $w^\star = 0.6748\ldots$; one step already got within 0.008.

**ROC and AUC.** Scores $(0.9, 0.7, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3)$ with labels $(1, 0, 1, 1, 0)$: $P = 3$, $N = 2$.

| threshold | $+\infty$ | 0.9 | 0.7 | 0.6 | 0.4 | 0.3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| (FPR, TPR) | (0, 0) | (0, 1/3) | (1/2, 1/3) | (1/2, 2/3) | (1/2, 1) | (1, 1) |

The area is $\frac12 \cdot \frac13 + \frac12 \cdot 1 = \frac23$. Check by pairs: positive 0.9 beats both negatives, 0.6 beats only 0.3, 0.4 beats only 0.3: 4 of 6 pairs.

**ECE.** Probabilities $(0.9, 0.8, 0.3, 0.6)$, labels $(1, 0, 0, 1)$, $B = 5$. Predictions $(1, 1, 0, 1)$, confidences $(0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6)$, correct $(\text{yes}, \text{no}, \text{yes}, \text{yes})$. Bin indices $\lceil 5c \rceil - 1$: $4, 3, 3, 2$. Bin 4: conf 0.9, acc 1, gap 0.1; bin 3: conf 0.75, acc 0.5, gap 0.25; bin 2: conf 0.6, acc 1, gap 0.4. ECE $= \frac14 (0.1) + \frac24 (0.25) + \frac14 (0.4) = 0.25$. These three examples are the first three tests.

## 4. The interface

```python
def logistic_regression_fit(X: ArrayLike, y: ArrayLike, l2: float, iters: int, fit_intercept: bool = True) -> NDArray: ...
def logistic_predict_proba(X: ArrayLike, w: ArrayLike, fit_intercept: bool = True) -> NDArray: ...
def roc_curve(scores: ArrayLike, labels: ArrayLike) -> tuple[NDArray, NDArray, NDArray]: ...   # fpr, tpr, thresholds
def roc_auc(scores: ArrayLike, labels: ArrayLike) -> float: ...
def reliability_bins(probs: ArrayLike, labels: ArrayLike, n_bins: int = 15) -> tuple[NDArray, NDArray, NDArray]: ...
def ece(probs: ArrayLike, labels: ArrayLike, n_bins: int = 15) -> float: ...
```

The intercept is the **last** weight, the layout `L6.5` writes into the linear head's `b`. `roc_curve` starts at $(0, 0)$ with threshold $+\infty$ and has one more point per distinct score; `roc_auc` is `trapezoid(tpr, fpr)`. Bins are $(b/B, (b+1)/B]$ with index $\operatorname{clip}(\lceil cB \rceil - 1, 0, B - 1)$.
