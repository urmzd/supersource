## Key Takeaways

- Elimination is LU: the multipliers are $L$, the result is $U$, and partial pivoting keeps every multiplier at most 1 in size (q4 to q7).
- A basis is a minimal spanning set; its size, the dimension, is the same for every basis, and any $n + 1$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are dependent (q13, q20).
- Rank plus nullity equals the number of columns: every column either adds a direction to the image or a direction to the null space (q23 to q25).
- The determinant measures how a matrix scales volume; it is the product of the eigenvalues and is 0 exactly when the matrix is singular (q31, q34, q40).
- Repeated multiplication by $A$ is governed by its eigenvalues: $A^k v = \lambda^k v$, power iteration converges at rate $|\lambda_2/\lambda_1|$, and a spectral radius below 1 shrinks everything (q41 to q43).

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start S-M03a             # writes solve/S-M03a.toml and the four proof files
ss check S-M03a             # SymPy checks the answers, then asks each proof rubric (y/n)
ss check S-M03a --regrade   # ask the rubrics again after you change a proof
```

## 1. Why now

Your Pass 2 code factors matrices: `M03.2` writes LU with partial pivoting, `M03.3` Householder QR and orthogonal initialization, `M03.4` power iteration and the spectral radius that `L3.1` uses to diagnose exploding gradients. Their tests compare your factors with numpy's, but a factorization that "matches numpy" is only meaningful if you know what the factors are supposed to be and why they exist: why pivoting is needed, what rank and null space mean for a least-squares fit, why an eigenvalue above 1 makes a recurrent network blow up. This set works those ideas by hand on matrices small enough to check on paper.

## 2. Principles

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ | a matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns | matrix |
| $x, b$ | the unknown and the right-hand side of $Ax = b$ | vectors |
| $P, L, U$ | permutation, unit lower triangular, upper triangular: $PA = LU$ | $n \times n$ |
| $\operatorname{span}\{v_i\}$ | all linear combinations $\sum c_i v_i$ | subspace |
| $\dim V$ | the number of vectors in any basis of $V$ | integer |
| $\operatorname{rank} A$ | the dimension of the column space (equal to that of the row space) | integer |
| $N(A)$ | the null space $\{x : Ax = 0\}$; its dimension is the nullity | subspace |
| $\det A$ | the determinant of a square matrix | real |
| $\lambda, v$ | an eigenvalue and an eigenvector: $Av = \lambda v$, $v \ne 0$ | scalar, vector |
| $\rho(A)$ | the spectral radius, $\max |\lambda|$ | real |
| $Q, R$ | orthonormal columns and upper triangular: $A = QR$ | matrices |

### 2.1 Elimination and LU

Gaussian elimination subtracts multiples of a pivot row from the rows below it until the matrix is upper triangular, $U$. Recording each multiplier $\ell_{ij}$ (the amount of row $j$ subtracted from row $i$) in a unit lower triangular $L$ gives $A = LU$, so solving $Ax = b$ becomes two triangular solves. If a pivot is 0 the rows must be exchanged, and if it is merely small, dividing by it amplifies rounding errors; **partial pivoting** swaps the row with the largest $|a_{ij}|$ in the current column into the pivot position, giving $PA = LU$ with every $|\ell_{ij}| \le 1$. The **reduced row echelon form** continues until each pivot is 1 and the only nonzero entry in its column. A system has no solution (inconsistent), exactly one, or infinitely many (a free variable).

### 2.2 Span, independence, basis, dimension

Vectors are **linearly independent** when $\sum c_i v_i = 0$ forces every $c_i = 0$. A **basis** of a subspace is an independent spanning set, and every basis has the same size, the **dimension**. The pivot columns of $A$ are a basis of its column space; the special solutions (one per free variable) are a basis of its null space. **Coordinates** in a basis are the unique coefficients $c$ with $\sum c_i v_i = x$: solve a linear system.

### 2.3 Linear maps and rank-nullity

A map $T$ is **linear** when $T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y)$ and $T(cx) = cT(x)$; then $T(x) = Ax$ where column $j$ of $A$ is $T(e_j)$. Composition is multiplication: $S \circ T$ has matrix $S\,T$ (apply $T$ first, so it is on the right). For $A$ with $n$ columns, **rank-nullity** says $\operatorname{rank} A + \dim N(A) = n$.

### 2.4 Determinants

The determinant is the signed volume scale factor of $x \mapsto Ax$: $|\det [u\ v]|$ is the area of the parallelogram spanned by $u$ and $v$. It is multiplicative, $\det(AB) = \det A \det B$, so $\det(A^{-1}) = 1/\det A$; it scales as $\det(cA) = c^n \det A$ for $n \times n$ $A$; a triangular matrix's determinant is the product of its diagonal; and $\det A = 0$ exactly when $A$ is singular.

### 2.5 Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

$\lambda$ is an eigenvalue when $A - \lambda I$ is singular, that is, a root of the **characteristic polynomial** $\det(tI - A)$; the product of the eigenvalues is $\det A$ and their sum is the trace. A real matrix may have complex eigenvalues (a rotation moves every real vector). If $v$ is an eigenvector, $A^k v = \lambda^k v$, so the largest $|\lambda|$, the **spectral radius** $\rho(A)$, decides whether repeated application grows ($\rho > 1$) or shrinks ($\rho < 1$). **Power iteration** repeats $v \leftarrow Av / \lVert Av \rVert$; the component along the second eigenvector shrinks by $|\lambda_2/\lambda_1|$ per step.

### 2.6 Orthogonality and QR

The projection of $b$ onto the line through $u$ is $\frac{u \cdot b}{u \cdot u} u$. **Gram-Schmidt** subtracts from each column its projections onto the previous orthonormal vectors and normalizes the rest, giving $A = QR$; requiring a positive diagonal of $R$ makes the factorization unique. Least squares minimizes $\lVert Ax - b \rVert^2$; its solution satisfies the **normal equations** $A^\top A x = A^\top b$, which QR solves stably as $Rx = Q^\top b$ (`M03.5`).

## 3. Worked example by hand

This is a sibling of q6, q7, and q36, not one of the graded problems.

**LU with partial pivoting.** $A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 6 & 4 \end{pmatrix}$. The largest entry in column 1 is 6, in row 2, so swap: $P = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, $PA = \begin{pmatrix} 6 & 4 \\ 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$. The multiplier is $\ell_{21} = 2/6 = 1/3$, and row 2 becomes $(2, 1) - \frac13 (6, 4) = (0, -1/3)$. So $L = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 1/3 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, $U = \begin{pmatrix} 6 & 4 \\ 0 & -1/3 \end{pmatrix}$. Check: $LU = \begin{pmatrix} 6 & 4 \\ 2 & 4/3 - 1/3 \end{pmatrix} = PA$. In `solve/` the factor $L$ would be `answer = "[[1, 0], [1/3, 1]]"`.

**Eigenvalues and an eigenvector.** $B = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$ is triangular, so $\det(tI - B) = (t - 3)(t - 2)$ and the eigenvalues are 3 and 2. For $\lambda = 2$: $(B - 2I)v = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} v = 0$ gives $v = (1, -1)$, or any nonzero multiple; the checker accepts `[2, -2]` too when the key says `up_to = "scalar"`. The product of the eigenvalues is $6 = \det B$.

## 4. The problem set

Write each answer in `solve/S-M03a.toml`:

```toml
[q1]
answer = "[-4, 9/2]"
[q4]
answer = "[[1, 0], [2, 1]]"
[q15]
answer = "[[-1, 1, 0], [-1, 0, 1]]"
[q36]
answer = "{1, 3}"
[q10]
proof = "S-M03a/q10.md"
```

A vector is a flat list (one column); a matrix is a list of rows; a basis is a list of vectors, and any basis of the right space passes. Entries are exact: `1/sqrt(2)`, not `0.7071`.
