- **Estimated time**: 3 weeks at 10 to 12 h/week; in the course, Pass 2 (M08.1 to M08.3) and Pass 9 (M08.4)

## Key Takeaways

- **Autodiff is the chain rule applied to a program, not to a formula.** Forward mode carries a derivative alongside each value; reverse mode records the computation and walks it backward once.
- **Reverse mode costs about one extra forward pass per scalar output**, which is why every neural network trains with it: one loss, millions of parameters.
- **Every op needs one rule: its vector-Jacobian product (VJP).** The trace trick and matrix differentials derive the VJPs of matmul, softmax, LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and cross-entropy in a few lines each.
- **Gradients are checked, never trusted.** Central differences in float64 against the analytic VJP catch nearly every wrong rule.
- **Memory is the price of reverse mode.** Activation checkpointing trades recomputation for memory on a $\sqrt{n}$ schedule.

## How to Study

Read Parr and Howard first, deriving every identity by hand, then the Baydin survey sections 2 and 3. Build micrograd from memory once before the course modules. In the course, `S-M08` checks the derivations and `M08.1` to `M08.3` are the code: dual numbers, a scalar `Value`, then the closed-form VJPs that `L0.2` registers as ops.

# Concepts & Techniques

## Core Insight

A gradient is a linear map, and a program is a composition of small differentiable steps. Forward mode pushes a tangent through each step (a Jacobian-vector product); reverse mode pulls a cotangent back through each step (a vector-Jacobian product). Knowing the VJP of each primitive is enough to differentiate any program built from them, and knowing it in closed form is what makes it fast and stable.

## 1. Forward mode with dual numbers

**Key ideas**:
- **Dual number** $a + b\varepsilon$ with $\varepsilon^2 = 0$: evaluating $f(x + \varepsilon) = f(x) + f'(x)\varepsilon$ gives value and derivative together.
- **Cost**: one pass per input direction, so it suits few inputs and many outputs.
- **Call site**: `M08.1` is the derivative oracle for the elementwise ops of `L0.2`.

## 2. Reverse mode on a graph

**Key ideas**:
- **Tape**: record each op and its inputs; `backward` visits nodes in reverse topological order (`M06.1`) and accumulates $\bar{x} \mathrel{+}= \bar{y}\, \partial y / \partial x$.
- **Broadcasting**: the gradient of a broadcast input is the sum of the upstream gradient over the broadcast axes (`unbroadcast`).
- **Call site**: `M08.2` is the scalarized oracle for `L0.1` broadcasting backward.

## 3. Matrix differentials and closed-form VJPs

**Key ideas**:
- **Trace trick**: for scalar $L$, $dL = \operatorname{tr}(G^{\top} dY)$; with $Y = AB$, $dY = dA\,B + A\,dB$ gives $\bar{A} = G B^{\top}$, $\bar{B} = A^{\top} G$.
- **Softmax**: $\bar{x} = y \odot (g - \langle g, y \rangle)$; fused with cross-entropy the gradient is $\text{softmax}(z) - \text{onehot}(t)$.
- **Normalization**: LayerNorm and RMSNorm VJPs reuse the saved reciprocal standard deviation; beat 2 of `M08.3` defines both functions before deriving them.

## 4. Second order and memory

**Key ideas**:
- **Hessian-vector product** by finite differences of gradients, or forward-over-reverse, without forming the Hessian.
- **Checkpointing**: keep activations at segment boundaries and recompute inside a segment; $\sqrt{n}$ segments balance memory and time (`M08.4`, used by `L11.1`).

No chapters yet: they arrive with authoring batch B3 (M08.1 to M08.3, S-M08) and B11 (M08.4) (course/DESIGN.md 9). `ss lint --fix-index` then fills this table from the registry.
