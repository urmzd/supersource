## Key Takeaways

- A gradient has the shape of its variable, and broadcasting in the forward pass becomes a sum over the broadcast axes in the backward pass (q1, q3).
- Write the differential $dL = \operatorname{tr}(G^\top dY)$, push $dY$ through the product rule, rotate with the cyclic trace, and read off the gradient: $\partial L/\partial W = X^\top G$, $\partial L/\partial X = G W^\top$ (q18, q20).
- Softmax's VJP is $y \odot (g - \langle g, y\rangle)$ and cross-entropy's gradient with respect to logits is $\mathrm{softmax}(z) - \mathrm{onehot}(y)$, both $O(V)$ (q21, q24, q28).
- Normalizations differentiate through their statistics: LayerNorm's input gradient sums to zero, and RMSNorm's is orthogonal to $x$ (q26, q27).
- Reverse mode costs one pass per output, so one backward pass gives a million-parameter gradient, at about twice the forward FLOPs (q29, q32).

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start S-M08              # writes solve/S-M08.toml and one file per derivation
ss check S-M08              # SymPy checks the answers, then asks each rubric (y/n)
ss check S-M08 --regrade    # ask the rubrics again after you change a derivation
```

## 1. Why now

By this point in Pass 2 you have a scalar autograd engine (`M08.2`) that differentiates one number at a time. It is correct and hopeless at scale: applying one $576 \times 576$ weight to one vector would create a third of a million scalar multiplication nodes. `M08.3` replaces it with closed-form vector-Jacobian products, one per operation, that take the upstream gradient as an array and return the input gradients as arrays, and `L0.2` registers them as the ops of your tensor autograd. Each closed form is a derivation you must get right on paper first, because a gradient with the right shape and the wrong value trains, slowly and badly, rather than crashing. This set drills the shape bookkeeping, matrix differentials, the trace trick, the VJPs of softmax, log-softmax, cross-entropy, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm, the cost model of forward and reverse mode, and the attention backward you will meet again in `L9.4`.

## 2. Principles

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $L$ | a scalar loss | scalar |
| $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k}$, $W \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$ | matrices; $Y = XW \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ | |
| $G = \partial L / \partial Y$ | upstream gradient, same shape as $Y$ | $m \times n$ |
| $dX$ | differential: first-order change of $X$ | like $X$ |
| $\operatorname{tr}(A)$ | trace, $\sum_i A_{ii}$ | scalar |
| $\langle A, B \rangle$ | Frobenius inner product, $\operatorname{tr}(A^\top B) = \sum_{ij} A_{ij} B_{ij}$ | scalar |
| $\odot$ | elementwise product | |
| $J_f$ | Jacobian of $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$, $(J_f)_{ij} = \partial f_i / \partial x_j$ | $m \times n$ |
| $\mathrm{softmax}(x)_i$ | $e^{x_i} / \sum_k e^{x_k}$ | vector |
| $\delta_{ij}$ | 1 if $i = j$, else 0 | |
| $\mathbf{1}$ | the all-ones vector | |

### 2.1 Shapes, layouts, and strides

The convention in this course (and in PyTorch) is the **denominator layout**: $\partial L/\partial X$ has the shape of $X$, entry by entry $(\partial L/\partial X)_{ij} = \partial L/\partial X_{ij}$. A row-major array of shape $(n_0, n_1, n_2)$ stores index $(i, j, k)$ at element offset $i\,s_0 + j\,s_1 + k\,s_2$ with **strides** $s = (n_1 n_2, n_2, 1)$. A **view** reinterprets the same memory with other strides: swapping two axes swaps their strides and copies nothing. **Broadcasting** reuses one value along an axis; its backward is a sum over that axis, which `L0.1`'s `unbroadcast` performs. A **Jacobian** of a map from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$ is $m \times n$, which for a layer is enormous; reverse mode never builds it.

### 2.2 Differentials

The **differential** of $F$ at $X$ is the linear part of $F(X + dX) - F(X)$. It obeys the rules you know for scalars, with the order of factors kept: $d(A + B) = dA + dB$, $d(AB) = (dA)B + A(dB)$, $d(A^\top) = (dA)^\top$, $d\operatorname{tr}(A) = \operatorname{tr}(dA)$, and $d(X^{-1}) = -X^{-1}(dX)X^{-1}$ (q16). For $\log \det X$ the result is $\operatorname{tr}(X^{-1} dX)$. For an elementwise function $y = f(x)$, $dy = f'(x) \odot dx$, so its Jacobian is diagonal.

### 2.3 The trace trick

For a scalar $L$ of a matrix $M$, $dL = \sum_{ij} \frac{\partial L}{\partial M_{ij}}\, dM_{ij} = \langle \partial L/\partial M, dM \rangle = \operatorname{tr}((\partial L/\partial M)^\top dM)$. So **once $dL$ is written as $\operatorname{tr}(N^\top dM)$, the gradient is $N$**. The tool for getting there is the **cyclic property**: $\operatorname{tr}(ABC) = \operatorname{tr}(BCA) = \operatorname{tr}(CAB)$ whenever the products are defined (a cyclic shift, never an arbitrary swap), together with $\operatorname{tr}(A^\top) = \operatorname{tr}(A)$. A scalar is its own trace, so any scalar expression may be wrapped in one.

### 2.4 VJPs of the ops you will register

A **vector-Jacobian product** maps an upstream gradient $g = \partial L/\partial y$ to $\partial L/\partial x = J^\top g$ without forming $J$. The ones `M08.3` implements:

| Op | Forward | VJP |
|---|---|---|
| matmul | $Y = XW$ | $\partial L/\partial X = G W^\top$, $\partial L/\partial W = X^\top G$ |
| softmax | $y = \mathrm{softmax}(x)$ | $y \odot (g - \langle g, y \rangle \mathbf{1})$ |
| log-softmax | $\ell = x - \mathrm{LSE}(x)$ | $g - \mathrm{softmax}(x) \sum_i g_i$ |
| cross-entropy | $L = -\log \mathrm{softmax}(z)_t$ | $\mathrm{softmax}(z) - e_t$; a mean over $N$ kept positions divides by $N$ |
| RMSNorm | $y = w \odot x / r$, $r = \sqrt{\tfrac1n \sum x_i^2 + \epsilon}$ | $\frac{w \odot g}{r} - x\,\frac{\langle w \odot g, x\rangle}{n r^3}$ |
| LayerNorm | $\hat x = (x - \mu)/\sigma$, $y = \gamma \odot \hat x + \beta$ | with $\hat g = \gamma \odot g$: $\frac{1}{\sigma}\left(\hat g - \overline{\hat g} - \hat x\, \overline{\hat g \odot \hat x}\right)$ |

Here $\overline{v}$ is the mean of the entries of $v$, $\mu$ the mean of $x$, $\sigma = \sqrt{\tfrac1n \sum (x_i - \mu)^2 + \epsilon}$, and $e_t$ the one-hot vector of the target. **LayerNorm** and **RMSNorm** are functions of a whole row: LayerNorm centers and scales it to mean 0 and variance 1, RMSNorm only scales it to root-mean-square 1, and both then apply a learned gain. Because each normalizes by a statistic of its own input, the gradient has a correction term that a "treat the statistic as constant" derivation misses. Two checks catch it: LayerNorm's input gradient sums to zero (shifting $x$ changes nothing), and RMSNorm's is orthogonal to $x$ when $\epsilon = 0$ (scaling $x$ changes nothing).

### 2.5 Forward versus reverse mode

For $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$, forward mode (`M08.1`'s dual numbers) computes one Jacobian-vector product $J v$ per pass, so the full Jacobian takes $n$ passes. Reverse mode computes one $J^\top u$ per pass, so it takes $m$. A loss has $m = 1$: one backward pass gives the gradient with respect to every parameter, at the price of storing the forward activations it needs. For a matrix product the backward computes two products of the same size as the forward one, so backward costs about twice the forward FLOPs, and a training step about three times: the $6N$ per token of `S-M05` q13.

### 2.6 Attention

**Scaled dot-product attention** (SDPA) for $T$ positions computes scores $S = QK^\top/\sqrt{d}$, weights $P = \mathrm{softmax}(S)$ along each row, and output $O = PV$. Its backward chains the three rules above: matmul for $O = PV$, softmax row by row, matmul again for $S$ (q34).

## 3. Worked example by hand

This is a sibling of q21 and q24, not one of the graded problems.

**Softmax VJP.** Let $x = (0, 0)$, so $y = \mathrm{softmax}(x) = (1/2, 1/2)$, and let the upstream gradient be $g = (1, 3)$.

- $\langle g, y \rangle = 1 \cdot \tfrac12 + 3 \cdot \tfrac12 = 2$.
- $g - 2 \cdot \mathbf{1} = (-1, 1)$.
- $\partial L/\partial x = y \odot (-1, 1) = (-1/2, 1/2)$.

Check against the Jacobian: for two classes $J = \begin{pmatrix} y_1(1-y_1) & -y_1 y_2 \\ -y_1 y_2 & y_2(1 - y_2)\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1/4 & -1/4 \\ -1/4 & 1/4 \end{pmatrix}$, and $J^\top g = (1/4 - 3/4,\ -1/4 + 3/4) = (-1/2, 1/2)$. The entries sum to 0, as every softmax input gradient must. In `solve/` this is `answer = "[-1/2, 1/2]"`.

**Cross-entropy.** Logits $z = (\log 3, 0)$, target class 0. Then $\mathrm{softmax}(z) = (3/4, 1/4)$, $L = -\log(3/4) = \log(4/3)$, and $\partial L/\partial z = (3/4 - 1, 1/4 - 0) = (-1/4, 1/4)$: lower the wrong logit, raise the right one, by how far the prediction is from the target.

## 4. The problem set

Write each answer in `solve/S-M08.toml`; lettered parts are their own tables:

```toml
[q1.a]
answer = "[2, 3, 5]"
[q5]
answer = "[2*x1 + 2*x2, 2*x1 + 6*x2]"
[q18.a]
answer = "[[1, 3], [2, 4]]"
[q20]
proof = "S-M08/q20.md"
```

Vectors are flat lists; matrices are lists of rows; write $e$ as `E` and $\sqrt{\cdot}$ as `sqrt(...)`. A gradient answer must have the variable's shape.

### Layouts and shapes

A linear layer computes $Y = X W^\top + b$ for a batch $X$ of shape $(B, T, d_{in}) = (2, 3, 4)$, stored row-major in float32, with $W$ of shape $(d_{out}, d_{in}) = (5, 4)$ and $b$ of shape $(5)$. $L$ is a scalar loss.
