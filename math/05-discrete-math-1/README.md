# Concepts & Techniques

## Core Insight

Discrete mathematics is the mathematics of distinct, separated structures (as opposed to the
continuous structures of calculus). Proof is the central activity: you must learn to construct
airtight logical arguments. Every concept in this course -- sets, logic, counting, relations,
functions -- appears directly in computer science. Sets become data structures, logic becomes
boolean algebra and type systems, induction becomes recursive correctness arguments, relations
become database schemas, and functions become the foundation of programming.

## 1. Sets

**Textbook sections**: Ch 1, Sections 1.1-1.8

**Key definitions**:
- **Set**: An unordered collection of distinct elements; described by listing {1,2,3} or set-builder {x in Z : x > 0}
- **Subset**: A is a subset of B if every element of A is in B
- **Power set**: P(A) = the set of all subsets of A; |P(A)| = 2^|A|
- **Union**: A union B = {x : x in A or x in B}
- **Intersection**: A intersect B = {x : x in A and x in B}
- **Complement**: A^c = {x in U : x not in A}
- **Cartesian product**: A x B = {(a,b) : a in A, b in B}; |A x B| = |A| * |B|

**Key theorems**:
- **De Morgan's Laws**: (A union B)^c = A^c intersect B^c, and (A intersect B)^c = A^c union B^c. *Intuition*: "not (this or that)" is the same as "not this and not that" -- negation swaps union and intersection.
- **Inclusion-Exclusion (2 sets)**: |A union B| = |A| + |B| - |A intersect B|. *Intuition*: adding the sizes double-counts the overlap, so subtract it once.
- **Power Set Cardinality**: |P(A)| = 2^|A|. *Intuition*: for each element, independently choose "in" or "out" -- that is 2 choices per element.

**Worked example**:
> Prove that A intersect (B union C) = (A intersect B) union (A intersect C). Let x be in A intersect (B union C). Then x is in A and x is in B union C. Case 1: x in B. Then x in A intersect B, so x in (A intersect B) union (A intersect C). Case 2: x in C. Then x in A intersect C, so x in (A intersect B) union (A intersect C). The reverse direction is similar.

**Challenge problems**: Hammack Ch 1, Exercises: #31-36

## 2. Logic

**Textbook sections**: Ch 2, Sections 2.1-2.10

**Key definitions**:
- **Proposition**: A statement that is either true or false
- **Conjunction (AND)**: P AND Q is true only when both P and Q are true
- **Disjunction (OR)**: P OR Q is true when at least one of P, Q is true
- **Negation (NOT)**: NOT P reverses the truth value
- **Conditional**: P => Q (if P then Q); false only when P is true and Q is false
- **Biconditional**: P <=> Q (P if and only if Q); true when P and Q have the same truth value
- **Predicate**: A statement with a variable, e.g., P(x) = "x is even"
- **Universal quantifier**: For all x, P(x) -- asserts P holds for every x in the domain
- **Existential quantifier**: There exists x such that P(x) -- asserts P holds for at least one x

**Key theorems**:
- **Logical Equivalences**: P => Q is equivalent to NOT P OR Q. *Intuition*: "if P then Q" only fails when P is true and Q is false; in all other cases, the implication holds.
- **Contrapositive**: P => Q is equivalent to NOT Q => NOT P. *Intuition*: "if it rained then the ground is wet" is the same as "if the ground is dry then it didn't rain."
- **Negation of Quantifiers**: NOT(for all x, P(x)) is equivalent to there exists x such that NOT P(x). NOT(there exists x, P(x)) is equivalent to for all x, NOT P(x). *Intuition*: negation swaps quantifiers, just as De Morgan's Laws swap AND/OR.

**Worked example**:
> Negate "For every epsilon > 0, there exists delta > 0 such that |x-a| < delta implies |f(x)-L| < epsilon." Negation: "There exists epsilon > 0 such that for all delta > 0, there exists x with |x-a| < delta and |f(x)-L| >= epsilon." Each quantifier flips, and the implication becomes a conjunction with negated consequent.

**Challenge problems**: Hammack Ch 2, Exercises: #23-28

## 3. Counting

**Textbook sections**: Ch 3, Sections 3.1-3.5

**Key definitions**:
- **Multiplication principle**: If task 1 has m outcomes and task 2 has n outcomes, the sequence has m*n outcomes
- **Addition principle**: If task 1 has m outcomes and task 2 has n outcomes (mutually exclusive), total is m+n
- **Permutation**: An ordered arrangement; P(n,k) = n! / (n-k)!
- **Combination**: An unordered selection; C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)
- **Binomial coefficient**: C(n,k), also written "n choose k"

**Key theorems**:
- **Binomial Theorem**: (x + y)^n = Sum from k=0 to n of C(n,k) * x^(n-k) * y^k. *Intuition*: expanding (x+y)^n, each term chooses x from some factors and y from the rest. The number of ways to choose k factors for y is C(n,k).
- **Pascal's Identity**: C(n,k) = C(n-1,k-1) + C(n-1,k). *Intuition*: to choose k items from n, either include item n (then choose k-1 from the remaining n-1) or exclude it (choose k from n-1).
- **Stars and Bars**: The number of ways to distribute n identical objects into k distinct bins is C(n+k-1, k-1). *Intuition*: arrange n stars and k-1 dividers in a row.

**Worked example**:
> How many 5-card poker hands contain exactly 2 aces? Choose 2 aces from 4: C(4,2) = 6. Choose remaining 3 cards from the 48 non-aces: C(48,3) = 17296. Total: 6 * 17296 = 103776.

> How many bit strings of length 8 have exactly 3 ones? Choose positions for the ones: C(8,3) = 56.

**Challenge problems**: Hammack Ch 3, Exercises: #25-30

## 4. Direct Proof

**Textbook sections**: Ch 4, Sections 4.1-4.5

**Key definitions**:
- **Direct proof of P => Q**: Assume P is true, then use definitions, theorems, and logical reasoning to conclude Q

**Key technique**:
- Assume the hypothesis. Unpack definitions. Manipulate using known results. Arrive at the conclusion.

**Worked example**:
> Prove: If n is odd, then n^2 is odd. Assume n is odd, so n = 2k+1 for some integer k. Then n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1. Since 2k^2 + 2k is an integer, n^2 has the form 2m+1, so n^2 is odd.

> Prove: If a | b and b | c, then a | c. Since a | b, we have b = ak for some integer k. Since b | c, we have c = bj for some integer j. Then c = (ak)j = a(kj). Since kj is an integer, a | c.

**Essential problems**: Hammack Ch 4, Exercises: #1-8, #13-18, #23-28
**Challenge problems**: Hammack Ch 4, Exercises: #29-34

## 5. Contrapositive Proof

**Textbook sections**: Ch 5, Sections 5.1-5.3

**Key definitions**:
- **Contrapositive proof of P => Q**: Prove NOT Q => NOT P instead (logically equivalent)

**Key technique**:
- Use when the negation of Q gives you more to work with than assuming P directly.

**Worked example**:
> Prove: If n^2 is even, then n is even. Contrapositive: If n is odd, then n^2 is odd. Assume n = 2k+1. Then n^2 = 4k^2+4k+1 = 2(2k^2+2k)+1, which is odd. (This avoids the difficulty of working directly from "n^2 is even.")

> Prove: If 5x + 3 is odd, then x is even. Contrapositive: If x is odd (x = 2k+1), then 5x+3 = 10k+5+3 = 10k+8 = 2(5k+4), which is even.

**Essential problems**: Hammack Ch 5, Exercises: #1-8, #11-16
**Challenge problems**: Hammack Ch 5, Exercises: #17-20

## 6. Proof by Contradiction

**Textbook sections**: Ch 6, Sections 6.1-6.4

**Key definitions**:
- **Proof by contradiction**: Assume the statement is false, then derive a logical contradiction

**Key technique**:
- Assume NOT(statement). Reason logically until you reach an impossibility (e.g., a number that is both even and odd, or a rational that is irrational). Conclude the original statement must be true.

**Worked example**:
> Prove: sqrt(2) is irrational. Assume sqrt(2) = a/b where a/b is in lowest terms (gcd(a,b)=1). Then 2 = a^2/b^2, so a^2 = 2b^2. Thus a^2 is even, so a is even (by contrapositive from concept 5). Write a = 2c. Then 4c^2 = 2b^2, so b^2 = 2c^2, so b is even. But then both a and b are even, contradicting gcd(a,b)=1.

> Prove: There are infinitely many primes. Assume there are finitely many: p_1, p_2, ..., p_n. Consider N = p_1*p_2*...*p_n + 1. N is not divisible by any p_i (remainder 1). So N is either prime itself or has a prime factor not in the list. Contradiction.

**Essential problems**: Hammack Ch 6, Exercises: #1-8, #13-18
**Challenge problems**: Hammack Ch 6, Exercises: #19-24

## 7. Non-Conditional Proofs

**Textbook sections**: Ch 7, Sections 7.1-7.4

**Key definitions**:
- **If-and-only-if proof**: Prove both directions: P => Q and Q => P
- **Existence proof**: Show an object with the desired property exists (constructive or non-constructive)
- **Uniqueness proof**: Show at most one object has the property (assume two, show they are equal)
- **Proof by cases**: Break into exhaustive cases and prove each separately

**Worked example**:
> Prove: n is odd if and only if n^2 is odd. (=>) If n is odd, n=2k+1, n^2=4k^2+4k+1=2(2k^2+2k)+1 is odd. (<=) Contrapositive: if n is even, n=2k, n^2=4k^2=2(2k^2) is even. Both directions established.

**Essential problems**: Hammack Ch 7, Exercises: #1-8, #13-18, #25-30
**Challenge problems**: Hammack Ch 7, Exercises: #31-36

## 8. Mathematical Induction

**Textbook sections**: Ch 10, Sections 10.1-10.4

**Key definitions**:
- **Weak induction**: Prove P(base). Assume P(k), prove P(k+1). Conclude P(n) for all n >= base.
- **Strong induction**: Prove P(base). Assume P(j) for all base <= j <= k, prove P(k+1).
- **Structural induction**: Induction on recursively defined structures (trees, lists, formulas)

**Key theorems**:
- **Well-Ordering Principle**: Every nonempty subset of the natural numbers has a least element. *Intuition*: this is logically equivalent to the principle of induction -- if induction fails, there is a smallest counterexample, contradicting well-ordering.

**Worked example**:
> Prove: 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2. Base case: n=1, LHS = 1, RHS = 1(2)/2 = 1. Inductive step: Assume 1+2+...+k = k(k+1)/2. Then 1+2+...+k+(k+1) = k(k+1)/2 + (k+1) = (k+1)(k/2 + 1) = (k+1)(k+2)/2. This is the formula with n = k+1.

> Prove: 2^n > n for all n >= 1 (strong induction style). Base: 2^1 = 2 > 1. Assume 2^j > j for all 1 <= j <= k. Then 2^(k+1) = 2 * 2^k > 2k >= k+1 (since k >= 1). Done.

> Structural induction: Prove every binary tree with n internal nodes has n+1 leaves. Base: 0 internal nodes, 1 leaf. Inductive: A tree with root has left subtree (n_L internal, n_L+1 leaves) and right subtree (n_R internal, n_R+1 leaves). Total internal = n_L + n_R + 1. Total leaves = (n_L+1) + (n_R+1) = n_L + n_R + 2 = (internal nodes) + 1.

**Challenge problems**: Hammack Ch 10, Exercises: #33-38

## 9. Relations

**Textbook sections**: Ch 11, Sections 11.1-11.6

**Key definitions**:
- **Relation on A**: A subset R of A x A; we write a R b or (a,b) in R
- **Reflexive**: a R a for all a in A
- **Symmetric**: a R b implies b R a
- **Transitive**: a R b and b R c implies a R c
- **Equivalence relation**: A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive
- **Equivalence class**: [a] = {x in A : x R a}; the set of all elements equivalent to a
- **Partition**: A collection of nonempty, pairwise disjoint subsets whose union is A
- **Partial order**: A relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric (a R b and b R a implies a = b), and transitive

**Key theorems**:
- **Fundamental Theorem of Equivalence Relations**: The equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on A form a partition of A, and conversely every partition of A defines an equivalence relation. *Intuition*: equivalence relations and partitions are the same concept viewed from two angles. "Being equivalent" means "being in the same part."

**Worked example**:
> On Z, define a ~ b iff 3 | (a - b) (congruence mod 3). Reflexive: 3 | (a-a) = 0. Symmetric: if 3 | (a-b), then 3 | (-(a-b)) = (b-a). Transitive: if 3 | (a-b) and 3 | (b-c), then 3 | ((a-b)+(b-c)) = (a-c). Equivalence classes: [0] = {...,-6,-3,0,3,6,...}, [1] = {...,-5,-2,1,4,7,...}, [2] = {...,-4,-1,2,5,8,...}. These partition Z.

**Challenge problems**: Hammack Ch 11, Exercises: #23-28

## 10. Functions

**Textbook sections**: Ch 12, Sections 12.1-12.6

**Key definitions**:
- **Function**: A relation f from A to B such that every element of A is related to exactly one element of B
- **Injection (one-to-one)**: f(a) = f(b) implies a = b
- **Surjection (onto)**: For every b in B, there exists a in A with f(a) = b
- **Bijection**: A function that is both injective and surjective; establishes a one-to-one correspondence
- **Composition**: (g o f)(x) = g(f(x))
- **Inverse**: f^(-1) exists iff f is a bijection; f^(-1)(f(a)) = a

**Key theorems**:
- **Composition Preserves Properties**: If f and g are injective, then g o f is injective. If f and g are surjective, then g o f is surjective. *Intuition*: composing two "no-collision" maps gives a "no-collision" map; composing two "everything-is-hit" maps gives an "everything-is-hit" map.
- **Bijection and Inverse**: f has an inverse iff f is a bijection. *Intuition*: to "undo" a function, every output must come from exactly one input.
- **Cantor's Theorem**: |A| < |P(A)| for any set A (there is no surjection from A onto its power set). *Intuition*: there are always more subsets of a set than elements -- this is the source of different sizes of infinity.
- **Schroder-Bernstein**: If there exist injections A -> B and B -> A, then there exists a bijection A <-> B. *Intuition*: if each set "fits inside" the other, they must be the same size.

**Worked example**:
> Prove f: Z -> Z defined by f(n) = 2n + 1 is injective but not surjective. Injection: if 2a+1 = 2b+1, then a = b. Not surjective: is there n with 2n+1 = 4? That requires n = 3/2, which is not in Z. So 4 has no preimage.

> Prove f: R -> R defined by f(x) = x^3 is a bijection. Injection: if a^3 = b^3, then a = b (cube root is well-defined on R). Surjection: for any y in R, x = y^(1/3) satisfies f(x) = y. Inverse: f^(-1)(y) = y^(1/3).
