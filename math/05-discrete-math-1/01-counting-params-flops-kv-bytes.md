| **Module** | `M05.1` · build · Python · Pass 5 · 2 to 3 h |
| **You build** | `python/tinyllm/accounting.py`: `ModelConfig`, `param_count`, `flops_per_token`, `kv_bytes_per_token`, `memory_plan` |
| **Contract** | [`course/contracts/py/tinyllm/accounting.pyi`](../../course/contracts/py/tinyllm/accounting.pyi) |
| **Tests** | `course/tests/M05.1/test_accounting.py` (what they check: section 4), golden counts from Hugging Face transformers 5.19.0 in `course/fixtures/M05.1/hf_param_counts.json` (`course/oracle/M05.1/hf_param_counts.py`) |
| **Needs** | no code from earlier modules · reading: `M00.1` (powers and logs for orders of magnitude), `S-M05` (the product and sum rules) |
| **Used by** | `L7.5` checks its cache hook against `kv_bytes_per_token` · `L7.6` latent cache bytes · `L7.9` `{tinyllm} info` · later: `L10.2` admission by KV bytes, `L11.1` and `C1` memory and compute budgets |

| **Optional depth** | Kaplan et al., "Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models" (2020), section 2.1; Chowdhery et al., "PaLM" (2022), appendix B; Rajbhandari et al., "ZeRO" (2020), section 3.1; Korthikanti et al., "Reducing Activation Recomputation in Large Transformer Models" (2022), section 4 |

## Key Takeaways

- A decoder's parameters are a sum of products of a few config integers; counted per component, they match Hugging Face exactly for dense, GQA, MoE, and MLA models (`test_golden_hf_param_counts`).
- The KV cache grows with the number of **kv** heads, not query heads: GQA and MQA shrink it by $H / H_{kv}$, MLA replaces it with one latent per layer (`test_kv_bytes_scale_with_kv_heads_not_query_heads`, `test_mla_caches_the_latent`).
- A forward pass costs 2 FLOPs per parameter a token touches plus an attention term linear in the context; a training step costs three forwards (`test_smollm2_flops`, `test_flops_attention_term_is_linear_in_context`).
- AdamW training costs 16 bytes per parameter before activations, in fp32 or bf16 alike (`test_memory_plan_16_bytes_per_param`).
- Counts are exact Python integers: 671,026,404,352 is not $6.71 \times 10^{11}$ (`test_counts_are_python_ints`).

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start M05.1              # stubs accounting.py into your repo
ss tests M05.1              # read the test catalog first
ss check M05.1              # exit code is the verdict
ss diff  M05.1              # after passing: your code against the reference
```

## 1. Why now

Pass 5 swaps your 2017 transformer for a Llama-family model and, at its milestone, loads SmolLM2-135M from Hugging Face. Before you load 270 MB of weights, three questions need numbers, not guesses. Does your model have the same parameters as theirs (MS-L7 step 4 compares `{tinyllm} info` with Hugging Face's `num_parameters()`, and a missing norm or a double-counted tied head is off by thousands or by 28 million)? How many bytes of KV cache does one generated token cost (the Rust engine in Pass 7 admits requests by exactly this number, `L10.2`)? Will a training run fit in your laptop's memory (`C1` picks its model size from it)? This module answers all three by counting.

## 2. Principles

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $V$ | vocabulary size | `int` |
| $d$ | model width, `d_model` | `int` |
| $L$ | number of blocks, `n_layers` | `int` |
| $H$, $H_{kv}$ | query heads, key/value heads | `int` |
| $d_h$ | width of one head, `d_head` | `int` |
| $f$ | MLP hidden width, `d_ff` | `int` |
| $E$, $k$, $S$, $f_e$ | experts, experts per token (`top_k`), shared experts, expert width | `int` |
| $r$, $d_r$, $d_v$, $r_q$ | MLA latent width, rope width, value width, query latent width | `int` |
| $T$ | context length, `seq_len` | `int` |
| $P$ | total parameters | `int` |
| $N$ | matmul parameters one token touches | `int` |
| $b$ | bytes per number (`dtype_bytes`: 2 for bf16, 4 for fp32) | `int` |

### 2.1 The two counting rules

Everything here uses two rules from `S-M05`. **Product rule**: a matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns holds $m \cdot n$ numbers. **Sum rule**: parts that do not overlap add. A `Linear(in, out)` layer stores a weight of $\text{out} \cdot \text{in}$ numbers, plus $\text{out}$ more with a bias.

### 2.2 Embeddings and the head

The token embedding is a $V \times d$ table. The lm_head maps the final hidden state back to $V$ logits, another $V \times d$ matrix, unless the model **ties** them: then the head reuses the embedding and stores nothing (SmolLM2 does, saving $49152 \cdot 576 = 28{,}311{,}552$ numbers, a fifth of the model). Tying saves parameters but not work: the head is still a matrix product per token.

### 2.3 One block

A Llama block is RMSNorm, attention, RMSNorm, MLP (`L7.1` to `L7.5`).

- **Attention** (`L7.5`): $q$ is $H d_h \times d$, $k$ and $v$ are $H_{kv} d_h \times d$ each, the output projection is $d \times H d_h$: $2 d H d_h + 2 d H_{kv} d_h$. Qwen-style biases add $H d_h + 2 H_{kv} d_h$. MHA is $H_{kv} = H$; GQA shares each kv head among $H / H_{kv}$ query heads.
- **MLA** (DeepSeek-V2/V3) compresses keys and values into a latent of width $r$: a down projection $(r + d_r) \times d$ (the extra $d_r$ is one shared rope key), a norm of $r$, an up projection $H (d_h + d_v) \times r$, the queries $H (d_h + d_r) \times d$ (or through a latent of width $r_q$ with its own norm), and the output $d \times H d_v$.
- **Gated MLP** (`L7.2`): gate and up are $f \times d$, down is $d \times f$: $3 d f$.
- **Mixture of experts**: a router $E \times d$, then $E$ experts and $S$ shared experts of $3 d f_e$ each. A token is routed to $k$ experts, so it touches only $k + S$ of them: its **active** parameters are the total minus $(E - k) \cdot 3 d f_e$ per MoE layer. DeepSeek-V3 keeps its first 3 layers dense.
- **Norms**: two RMSNorm gains of $d$ per block (plus $r$ and $r_q$ inside MLA), and one final gain of $d$.

### 2.4 KV bytes

Generating token $t+1$ needs the keys and values of tokens $1..t$ in every layer. Recomputing them is quadratic work, so the engine caches them. One token adds a key and a value of $d_h$ numbers for each kv head in each layer:

$$\text{kv bytes per token} = L \cdot 2 \cdot H_{kv} \cdot d_h \cdot b .$$

Query heads do not appear. That is the whole argument for GQA: SmolLM2's 9 query heads read 3 kv heads, so its cache is a third of the MHA cache. MLA caches $r + d_r$ numbers per layer instead: DeepSeek-V3 stores $61 \cdot 576 \cdot 2 = 70{,}272$ bytes per token where an MHA cache of its 128 heads would take about 6 MB.

### 2.5 FLOPs per token

A multiply-add is 2 floating-point operations. In $y = W x$ each entry of $W$ is used in exactly one multiply-add per token, so a matrix product costs 2 FLOPs per parameter. Let $N$ be the matmul parameters one token touches: the attention projections, the active MLP, and the $V d$ head (tied or not; the embedding lookup is a copy and the norm gains are elementwise, so they are left out). Attention itself adds work that has no parameters: the token's query is dotted with $T$ keys ($T \cdot d_{qk}$ multiply-adds per head) and the $T$ weights average $T$ values ($T \cdot d_v$). Following PaLM, every token attends to all $T$ positions:

$$\text{forward} = 2N + 2 L H T (d_{qk} + d_v), \qquad \text{training step} = 3 \cdot \text{forward},$$

because the backward pass computes two products per forward product (the gradient with respect to the input and with respect to the weight, `M08.3`). The familiar "$6N$" is the training cost with the attention term dropped; for a small model at a long context that term is not small.

### 2.6 Training memory

With $P$ parameters at $b$ bytes: the weights ($bP$), their gradients ($bP$), the optimizer states in fp32 ($4P$ per state: SGD momentum keeps 1, AdamW keeps 2), and, when training in 16-bit, an fp32 **master copy** of the weights ($4P$) so small updates are not rounded away. AdamW in bf16 is $2 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 16$ bytes per parameter, and in fp32 $4 + 4 + 0 + 8 = 16$ too. Then the **activations**: backward needs values saved during the forward. Per token per layer this contract counts the norm inputs and outputs ($2d$ twice), $q$, $k$, $v$, one softmax row of $T$ probabilities per head, the attention output, and the four MLP intermediates ($4f$); plus fp32 logits of $V$ per token. The softmax rows make activations grow with $T^2$ per sequence, which is why `L11.1` recomputes them.

## 3. Worked example by hand

$V = 10$, $d = 4$, $L = 2$, $H = 2$, $H_{kv} = 1$, $d_h = 2$, $f = 6$, untied.

1. Embedding: $10 \cdot 4 = 40$. Head (untied): 40.
2. Attention per layer: $q$ $4 \cdot 4 = 16$, $k$ $2 \cdot 4 = 8$, $v$ 8, output $4 \cdot 4 = 16$: 48. Two layers: 96.
3. MLP per layer $3 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 = 72$, two layers 144.
4. Norms: $2 \cdot 4$ per layer, two layers, plus the final 4: 20.
5. Total $40 + 96 + 144 + 20 + 40 = 340$.
6. FLOPs at $T = 3$: $N = 96 + 144 + 40 = 280$, so $2N = 560$; attention $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot (2 + 2) = 96$. Forward 656, training $3 \cdot 656 = 1968$.
7. KV bytes in fp16: $2$ layers $\cdot\ 2$ (key and value) $\cdot\ 1$ kv head $\cdot\ 2$ wide $\cdot\ 2$ bytes $= 16$.
8. fp32 AdamW, batch 1, $T = 3$: weights 1360, grads 1360, master 0, optimizer $2 \cdot 4 \cdot 340 = 2720$. Saved values per token per layer: $8 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 4 = 26$ (attention) plus $8 + 4 \cdot 6 = 32$ (MLP) $= 58$; per token $2 \cdot 58 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 10 = 504$ bytes; three tokens 1512. Total 6952.

These are `test_hand_example_params`, `test_hand_example_flops_and_kv_bytes`, and `test_hand_example_memory_plan`.
