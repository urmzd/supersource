## Key Takeaways

- A **function** assigns exactly one output to each input in its **domain**; its **inverse** exists exactly when no two inputs share an output, and undoes it: $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$.
- A strictly **monotonic** function (always increasing, or always decreasing) is one-to-one, so it has an inverse; that is why $\exp$, $\ln$, the sigmoid, and softplus can all be inverted.
- Solving an **inequality** is solving the matching equation and testing the sign between its solutions; multiplying or dividing by a negative number, or applying a decreasing function, flips the direction.
- The other four parts are the pen-and-paper side of `M00.1` to `M00.4`: if a problem in part 2 to 5 stops you, read the beat 2 section of that module's chapter it names.

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start S-M00              # writes solve/S-M00.toml with an empty answer per question
$EDITOR solve/S-M00.toml    # answer = "(x + 7)/3", one line per question
ss check S-M00              # per-question pass/fail; feedback never shows the expected answer
```

Answers are ASCII math: `x^2`, `sqrt(x)`, `log(x)` (natural log), `E`, `pi`, `I`, `oo`; intervals like `(-oo, 2) U [3, 5)`; sets `{1, 2}`; vectors `[1, 2]`. A wrong answer reports where it differs (`q4 FAIL: differs at x=1.30`), not what it should be.

---

## 1. Why now

Pass 2 turns the math under your tracer system into code: logarithms that measure information (`M00.1`), rotations that encode position (`M00.2`), ladders of frequencies (`M00.3`), and polynomial evaluation that kernels run (`M00.4`), and after them calculus, linear algebra, probability, and optimization. Each of those chapters assumes you can manipulate the expressions fluently by hand: invert a function, combine logarithms, use an angle-addition formula, sum a geometric series, factor a polynomial, and solve an inequality. A bug in a derivation becomes a bug in code that tests catch late and explain poorly. This set checks the hand skills first, with a checker that accepts any correct form of an answer. Parts 1 and 6 also teach `M00.5`, functions, inverses, monotonicity, and inequalities, which has no build module of its own because none of it becomes code; `M01.1` (limits and derivatives) and `M05.2` build on it directly.

## 2. Principles

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $f: A \to B$ | a function from the set $A$ (its domain) to the set $B$ | |
| $f(x)$ | the output of $f$ at the input $x$ | |
| $\operatorname{dom} f$ | the domain: the inputs where $f$ is defined | a set or interval |
| $\operatorname{ran} f$ | the range: the outputs $f$ actually takes | a set or interval |
| $f \circ g$ | composition, $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$ | |
| $f^{-1}$ | the inverse function: $f^{-1}(y) = x$ exactly when $f(x) = y$ | |
| $(a, b)$, $[a, b]$ | the open interval $a < x < b$ and the closed interval $a \le x \le b$ | |
| $\cup$ | union of sets, written `U` in answers | |
| $\sigma(z)$ | the sigmoid $1/(1 + e^{-z})$ | |
| $\lvert x\rvert$ | absolute value: $x$ if $x \ge 0$, $-x$ otherwise | |

### 2.1 Functions, domains, ranges, composition

A **function** $f$ assigns to each input $x$ in its **domain** exactly one output $f(x)$. A formula alone leaves the domain implicit: it is every real $x$ where the formula makes sense. $\ln(4 - x^2)$ needs $4 - x^2 > 0$, so its domain is $(-2, 2)$; $1/(x - 3)$ needs $x \ne 3$. The **range** is the set of outputs that actually occur: the sigmoid $\sigma(z) = 1/(1 + e^{-z})$ takes every value strictly between 0 and 1 and never reaches either, so its range is $(0, 1)$. **Composition** chains functions: $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$ applies $g$ first. Order matters: with $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = x + 1$, $f(g(x)) = (x + 1)^2$ but $g(f(x)) = x^2 + 1$.

### 2.2 Inverses and monotonicity

$f$ is **one-to-one** when different inputs give different outputs. Then every output $y$ in the range comes from exactly one $x$, and the **inverse** $f^{-1}(y) = x$ undoes $f$: $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ and $f(f^{-1}(y)) = y$. To find it, write $y = f(x)$ and solve for $x$; the graph of $f^{-1}$ is the graph of $f$ reflected across the line $y = x$.

A function is **strictly increasing** when $x_1 < x_2$ implies $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$ (strictly decreasing: $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$). Either kind, called strictly **monotonic**, is one-to-one, because different inputs are ordered and so are their outputs. $e^x$, $\ln x$, $x^3 + x$, $\sigma$, and softplus $\ln(1 + e^x)$ are strictly increasing; $x^2$ is not monotonic on all of $\mathbb{R}$ ($(-2)^2 = 2^2$), so it has an inverse only on a half-line, where $\sqrt{\ }$ is it. `M01.1` gives the practical test: a function whose derivative is positive everywhere is strictly increasing.

### 2.3 Inequalities

An inequality is solved the way an equation is, with one extra rule: **multiplying or dividing both sides by a negative number reverses the direction** ($-2x < 6$ means $x > -3$), and so does applying a strictly decreasing function. Applying a strictly increasing function ($e^x$, $\ln$, $\sqrt{\ }$ on non-negative numbers) keeps it, which is how $e^x \le 2$ becomes $x \le \ln 2$.

For a polynomial or a quotient of polynomials, find where it is zero or undefined, cut the line there, and test the sign on each piece. $x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)$ is zero at 2 and 3, positive outside and negative between, so $x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0$ on $(-\infty, 2) \cup (3, \infty)$. An endpoint where the expression is zero belongs to the answer for $\ge$ and $\le$, never one where it is undefined. An absolute value is a distance: $|x - 3| < 2$ means "within 2 of 3", the interval $(1, 5)$. Two inequalities appear again in optimization and information theory: $x + 1/x \ge 2$ for $x > 0$ (with equality at $x = 1$; multiply by $x$ and get $(x - 1)^2 \ge 0$), and $\ln x \le x - 1$ (equality only at $x = 1$), the inequality behind Gibbs' inequality in `M11.1`.

| 3. trigonometry, complex numbers, Euler | q23 to q34 | [`M00.2`](02-trig-rotations-and-eulers-formula.md) sections 2.1 to 2.6 |

## 3. Worked example by hand

**A worked solution of a sibling of q5 and q6: the inverse and range of $f(x) = 2/(1 + e^{-x})$.**

1. *Range.* $e^{-x}$ takes every value in $(0, \infty)$, so $1 + e^{-x}$ takes every value in $(1, \infty)$ and $2/(1 + e^{-x})$ every value in $(0, 2)$, approaching 2 as $x \to \infty$ and 0 as $x \to -\infty$ without reaching either. Range: `(0, 2)`.
2. *Monotonic, so invertible.* As $x$ grows, $e^{-x}$ shrinks, the denominator shrinks, and $f(x)$ grows: $f$ is strictly increasing, hence one-to-one on $\mathbb{R}$.
3. *Solve $y = f(x)$ for $x$*, for $0 < y < 2$:
   $$y(1 + e^{-x}) = 2 \;\Rightarrow\; e^{-x} = \frac{2}{y} - 1 = \frac{2 - y}{y} \;\Rightarrow\; -x = \ln\frac{2 - y}{y} \;\Rightarrow\; x = \ln\frac{y}{2 - y}.$$
4. *Check.* $f(0) = 2/(1 + 1) = 1$, and $f^{-1}(1) = \ln(1/1) = 0$. Correct.
5. *Answer*, as you would write it in `solve/S-M00.toml` (in the variable of the question): `answer = "log(y/(2 - y))"`. The checker also accepts `log(y) - log(2 - y)` or `-log(2/y - 1)`, because it tests equality, not spelling: symbolically first, then at 32 seeded points of the domain the key declares.

**And one inequality, a sibling of q56: $\dfrac{x + 1}{x - 4} \le 0$.** The numerator is zero at $-1$ and the denominator at $4$. Signs: for $x < -1$ both factors are negative and the quotient positive; for $-1 < x < 4$ the numerator is positive and the denominator negative, so the quotient is negative; for $x > 4$ it is positive. Zero at $x = -1$ is allowed by $\le$; $x = 4$ divides by zero. Answer: `[-1, 4)`.

|---|---|---|
| inverting the steps in the original order ($f^{-1}(x) = (x - 7)/3$ for $f(x) = 3x - 7$) | every inverse in `M07.1` (inverse-CDF sampling) | q1, q3 |
| composing in the wrong order: $g(f(x))$ instead of $f(g(x))$ | the chain rule in `M01.2` and backpropagation in `L0.1` | q4, q9 |
| a closed endpoint where the expression is undefined | the domain of $\ln$ in every loss | q7, q56 |
