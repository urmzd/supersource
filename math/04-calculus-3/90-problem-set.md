## Key Takeaways

- The gradient collects the partial derivatives; it points uphill fastest, and its length is the steepest slope (q11, q30, q34).
- The multivariable chain rule multiplies Jacobians, and reverse mode multiplies them from the loss backward, one vector-Jacobian product at a time (q23, q27, q28).
- At a critical point the Hessian's eigenvalues decide minimum, maximum, or saddle, and their ratio is the condition number that slows gradient descent (q37, q42).
- A change of variables multiplies the area element by $|\det J|$: the $r$ in polar coordinates is why $\iint e^{-(x^2 + y^2)} = \pi$ (q26, q46, q50).
- At a constrained optimum the gradient is parallel to the constraint's gradient; maximum entropy under an energy constraint is a softmax (q51 to q58).

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start S-M04             # writes solve/S-M04.toml and the two proof files
ss check S-M04             # SymPy checks the answers, then asks each proof rubric (y/n)
ss check S-M04 --regrade   # ask the rubrics again after you change a proof
```

## 1. Why now

Your model has many parameters, and training moves all of them at once along the gradient. `M04.1` builds `gradcheck`, which compares your analytic gradients with central differences coordinate by coordinate, and `M04.2` computes Jacobians and the vector-Jacobian products that reverse-mode autodiff (`M08.2`, `L0.1`) chains together. `M10.1` then descends along gradients, and its convergence rate is set by the Hessian's condition number. `M07.3` sizes initial weights with Gaussian integrals in several variables, and `M11.5` reads the softmax as the solution of a constrained maximization. This set checks the hand computations behind all of them.

## 2. Principles

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $u \cdot v$, $u \times v$ | dot product; cross product (in $\mathbb{R}^3$) | scalar; vector |
| $\lVert v \rVert$ | Euclidean length, $\sqrt{v \cdot v}$ | real |
| $\partial f / \partial x_i$ | partial derivative: vary $x_i$, hold the others fixed | function |
| $\nabla f$ | gradient, the vector of partials | vector |
| $D_u f$ | directional derivative along a unit vector $u$, $\nabla f \cdot u$ | real |
| $J_g$ | Jacobian of $g: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$, $(J_g)_{ij} = \partial g_i / \partial x_j$ | $m \times n$ |
| $H_f$ | Hessian, $(H_f)_{ij} = \partial^2 f / \partial x_i \partial x_j$ | $n \times n$, symmetric |
| $\kappa$ | condition number of a positive definite $H$, $\lambda_{\max}/\lambda_{\min}$ | real |
| $\iint_D f\,dA$ | double integral over a region $D$ | real |
| $\lambda$ | a Lagrange multiplier | real |

### 2.1 Vectors and geometry

$u \cdot v = \sum_i u_i v_i = \lVert u \rVert \lVert v \rVert \cos\theta$, so $u \perp v$ exactly when $u \cdot v = 0$. The cross product $u \times v$ is perpendicular to both, with length the area of the parallelogram they span. A plane is $n \cdot x = d$ with normal $n$ (a cross product of two edge vectors), and the distance from a point $p$ to it is $|n \cdot p - d| / \lVert n \rVert$.

### 2.2 Partial derivatives and the gradient

A partial derivative differentiates in one variable with the rest held fixed, by the one-variable rules. Mixed second partials agree for smooth functions: $\partial^2 f/\partial x\,\partial y = \partial^2 f/\partial y\,\partial x$. Two gradients recur in machine learning: $\nabla_x \frac12 \lVert Ax - b \rVert^2 = A^\top(Ax - b)$, and the gradient of log-sum-exp, $\nabla \ln \sum_j e^{x_j}$, is the softmax of $x$.

### 2.3 The multivariable chain rule

If $z = f(x(t), y(t))$, then $\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dt}$: one term per path from $t$ to $z$. In general the Jacobian of a composite is the product of Jacobians, $J_{f \circ g} = J_f\, J_g$. A loss is a scalar at the end of a long chain, and **reverse mode** evaluates the product from the left: start with $u^\top = \partial L / \partial(\text{output})$ and multiply by one Jacobian at a time, $u^\top \leftarrow u^\top J$. Each step is a **vector-Jacobian product** (VJP), and backpropagation is nothing more.

### 2.4 Directional derivatives

The rate of change of $f$ at $x$ along a unit vector $u$ is $D_u f = \frac{d}{ds} f(x + s u)\big|_{s=0} = \nabla f \cdot u$, by the chain rule. By Cauchy-Schwarz it is at most $\lVert \nabla f \rVert$, reached at $u = \nabla f / \lVert \nabla f \rVert$: the gradient is the direction of steepest ascent, $-\nabla f$ of steepest descent, and directions perpendicular to $\nabla f$ follow a level curve.

### 2.5 The Hessian and the second-derivative test

At a **critical point** ($\nabla f = 0$), the second-order Taylor expansion is $f(x + h) \approx f(x) + \frac12 h^\top H h$. If every eigenvalue of $H$ is positive (positive definite), the point is a local minimum; all negative, a maximum; mixed signs, a saddle. For two variables: $\det H > 0$ and $f_{xx} > 0$ is a minimum, $\det H < 0$ is a saddle. For the quadratic $\frac12 x^\top H x$, gradient descent's error shrinks by about $1 - 1/\kappa$ per step with $\kappa = \lambda_{\max}/\lambda_{\min}$ (`M10.1`).

### 2.6 Multiple integrals and change of variables

A double integral over a rectangle is an iterated integral in either order; over other regions, the limits of the inner integral depend on the outer variable. Changing variables $(u, v) \mapsto (x, y)$ multiplies the area element by the absolute Jacobian determinant: $dx\,dy = |\det J|\,du\,dv$. Polar coordinates have $|\det J| = r$, so $dA = r\,dr\,d\theta$.

### 2.7 Lagrange multipliers

To optimize $f$ subject to $g = 0$, look for points where $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$ and $g = 0$: at a constrained optimum, moving along the constraint surface cannot change $f$ to first order, so $\nabla f$ has no component along the surface. With several constraints, $\nabla f = \sum_k \lambda_k \nabla g_k$. Solve the system, then compare the candidates' values.

## 3. Worked example by hand

This is a sibling of q27 and q52, not one of the graded problems.

**A backward pass by hand.** $h = 2x - 1$, $y = \sigma(h)$, $L = -\ln y$ (the cross-entropy of one positive example). At $x = 1/2$: forward, $h = 0$, $y = \sigma(0) = 1/2$, $L = \ln 2$. Backward, one factor at a time: $\frac{dL}{dy} = -\frac{1}{y} = -2$; $\frac{dy}{dh} = \sigma(h)(1 - \sigma(h)) = \frac14$; $\frac{dh}{dx} = 2$. So $\frac{dL}{dx} = (-2)\cdot\frac14\cdot 2 = -1$. The middle two factors combine to $\frac{dL}{dh} = -(1 - y) = y - 1 = -\frac12$, the familiar "prediction minus label" of a logistic output. In `solve/` the answer would be `answer = "-1"`.

**A constrained minimum.** Minimize $x^2 + 2y^2$ subject to $x + y = 3$. Lagrange: $\nabla f = (2x, 4y) = \lambda (1, 1)$, so $x = \lambda/2$, $y = \lambda/4$, and $x + y = 3\lambda/4 = 3$ gives $\lambda = 4$, $(x, y) = (2, 1)$, value $4 + 2 = 6$. Check by substitution: $f = x^2 + 2(3 - x)^2$, $f' = 2x - 4(3 - x) = 6x - 12 = 0$ at $x = 2$.

## 4. The problem set

Write each answer in `solve/S-M04.toml`:

```toml
[q5]
answer = "x + y + z = 1"
[q11]
answer = "[8, 7]"
[q35]
answer = "[[2, 3], [3, 4]]"
[q37]
answer = "saddle"
[q34]
proof = "S-M04/q34.md"
```

Vectors are flat lists, matrices lists of rows, and entries are exact (`-1/sqrt(5)`). For q33 either sign of the direction passes.
