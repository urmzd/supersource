## Key Takeaways

- On a quadratic, gradient descent multiplies each eigen-direction by $1 - \eta\lambda_i$, so it converges exactly when $0 < \eta < 2/L$, and its best rate is $\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa + 1}$ (q5).
- The condition number $\kappa = L/\mu$ sets how many steps a digit of accuracy costs: about $\kappa \ln 10$ at $\eta = 1/L$ (q2, q6).
- Momentum averages gradients with weights $\beta^k$, so a constant gradient produces steps $1/(1 - \beta)$ times larger; on a quadratic its modes shrink by $\sqrt\beta$ per step (q10, q11).
- Adam's moments start at zero and are biased toward it by a factor $1 - \beta^t$; the bias correction removes exactly that, and the first step is $\eta$ times the sign of the gradient (q14, q15, q17).
- AdamW's decay multiplies the weights by $1 - \eta\lambda$ outside the adaptive step, so it is not rescaled by $\hat v$ (q16).

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start S-M10a             # writes solve/S-M10a.toml and one file per proof
ss check S-M10a             # SymPy checks the answers, then asks each proof rubric (y/n)
ss check S-M10a --regrade   # ask the rubrics again after you change a proof
```

## 1. Why now

Your Pass 1 bigram was fitted by counting, with no optimizer at all. From Pass 2 on, every model is trained by an optimizer you write: `M10.1` gradient descent with a line search, `M10.2` SGD with momentum, and `M10.3` AdamW, which trains everything from `L4.1` to the capstone. Their tests compare your trajectories with PyTorch's step by step, and they fail on exactly the details this set drills: a step size past $2/L$ that oscillates, momentum that is summed one step off, a bias correction applied to the wrong moment, weight decay coupled into the adaptive step. When a training run diverges in Pass 5, the first questions you will ask are the ones here: what is the curvature, what is the condition number, and is the learning rate under the stability limit?

## 2. Principles

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ | the objective (loss) | |
| $x^\star, f^\star$ | a minimizer and the minimum value | |
| $\nabla f, \nabla^2 f$ | gradient and Hessian | $n$, $n \times n$ |
| $L$ | smoothness: $\nabla^2 f \preceq L I$ (largest curvature) | scalar |
| $\mu$ | strong convexity: $\nabla^2 f \succeq \mu I$ (smallest curvature) | scalar |
| $\kappa = L/\mu$ | condition number | scalar $\ge 1$ |
| $\eta$ (`eta`) | step size, the learning rate | scalar |
| $\beta$ (`beta`), $\beta_1, \beta_2$ | momentum and Adam's moment decay rates | in $[0, 1)$ |
| $m_t, v_t$ | Adam's first and second moment estimates | like $x$ |
| $\lambda$ | AdamW weight decay | scalar |

### 2.1 Convexity

A function is **convex** if every chord lies on or above it: $f(tx + (1-t)y) \le t f(x) + (1-t) f(y)$ for $t \in [0, 1]$. For twice-differentiable $f$ this is equivalent to $f'' \ge 0$ in one variable, and to a positive semidefinite Hessian ($v^\top \nabla^2 f\, v \ge 0$ for every $v$) in several. Convexity matters because every local minimum of a convex function is global. Sums and nonnegative multiples of convex functions are convex (q4); $\log$ is concave; $\mathrm{LSE}$ is convex, so cross-entropy in the logits is convex, while the loss of a whole network in its weights is not.

### 2.2 Smoothness, strong convexity, and the condition number

$f$ is **$L$-smooth** when its gradient changes by at most $L$ per unit of distance, which for twice-differentiable $f$ means every Hessian eigenvalue is at most $L$; it is **$\mu$-strongly convex** when every eigenvalue is at least $\mu > 0$. For a quadratic $f(x) = \frac12 x^\top A x$ with symmetric $A$, $L$ and $\mu$ are the largest and smallest eigenvalues of $A$. The **condition number** $\kappa = L/\mu$ measures how elongated the level sets are: $\kappa = 1$ is a round bowl, $\kappa = 10^4$ a long narrow valley.

### 2.3 Gradient descent on a quadratic

In the eigenbasis of $A$, gradient descent $x_{t+1} = x_t - \eta A x_t$ acts on each coordinate separately: coordinate $i$ is multiplied by $1 - \eta\lambda_i$ every step. It converges from every start exactly when $\lvert 1 - \eta \lambda_i \rvert < 1$ for every $i$, that is $0 < \eta < 2/L$. The worst factor $\max_i \lvert 1 - \eta\lambda_i \rvert$ is smallest when the extreme eigenvalues balance, $1 - \eta\mu = -(1 - \eta L)$, giving $\eta = \frac{2}{L + \mu}$ and rate $\frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa + 1}$. The safe default $\eta = 1/L$ gives rate $1 - 1/\kappa$. With rate $\rho$, reducing the error by a factor $\varepsilon$ takes $t \ge \ln(1/\varepsilon) / \ln(1/\rho)$ steps. Without strong convexity, an $L$-smooth convex $f$ still satisfies $f(x_t) - f^\star \le \frac{L\lVert x_0 - x^\star \rVert^2}{2t}$ at $\eta = 1/L$.

**Backtracking (Armijo) line search** avoids knowing $L$: start with $\alpha_0$ and shrink by $\rho$ until the step decreases $f$ by at least a fraction $c$ of what the linear model predicts, $f(x + \alpha d) \le f(x) + c\,\alpha \nabla f(x)^\top d$.

### 2.4 Momentum

Heavy-ball momentum keeps a velocity $v_{t+1} = \beta v_t + \nabla f(x_t)$ and steps $x_{t+1} = x_t - \eta v_{t+1}$. Unrolled, $v_{t+1} = \sum_{k=0}^{t} \beta^k \nabla f(x_{t-k})$: an exponentially weighted sum of past gradients, which for a constant gradient approaches $g/(1-\beta)$. On a one-dimensional quadratic with curvature $h$ the iterates satisfy the linear recurrence $x_{t+1} = (1 + \beta - \eta h)x_t - \beta x_{t-1}$; substituting $x_t = r^t$ gives a quadratic in $r$, and the iterates shrink like the larger root's modulus. When the roots are complex their product $\beta$ is the squared modulus, so both shrink by $\sqrt\beta$ per step, independent of $h$. Choosing $\beta$ so that this holds for every eigenvalue gives $\beta^\star = \left(\frac{\sqrt\kappa - 1}{\sqrt\kappa + 1}\right)^2$ and a rate of about $1 - 1/\sqrt\kappa$ instead of $1 - 1/\kappa$.

### 2.5 Adam and AdamW

Adam keeps exponential averages of the gradient and of its elementwise square, $m_t$ and $v_t$, starting from 0. Because they start at 0, early averages are too small by the factor $1 - \beta^t$ (q17), and dividing by it gives $\hat m_t$ and $\hat v_t$. The step $\eta\, \hat m_t / (\sqrt{\hat v_t} + \epsilon)$ is per-coordinate: dividing by the root mean square of recent gradients makes it roughly $\eta$ in size whatever the gradient's scale. On the first step $\hat m_1 = g_1$ and $\hat v_1 = g_1^2$, so the step is $\eta \cdot \mathrm{sign}(g_1)$ when $\epsilon = 0$. **AdamW** adds weight decay as a separate multiplication of the weights by $1 - \eta\lambda$, instead of adding $\lambda\theta$ to the gradient where $\hat v$ would rescale it.

## 3. Worked example by hand

This is a sibling of q5 and q16, not one of the graded problems.

**Step sizes on $f(x) = \frac12(2x_1^2 + 6x_2^2)$.** The Hessian is $\mathrm{diag}(2, 6)$, so $\mu = 2$, $L = 6$, $\kappa = 3$. Gradient descent converges for $0 < \eta < 2/6 = 1/3$. The best constant step is $\eta = 2/(6 + 2) = 1/4$, where the factors are $1 - 2/4 = 1/2$ and $1 - 6/4 = -1/2$: both coordinates shrink by $1/2$ per step, the rate $(\kappa - 1)/(\kappa + 1) = 2/4$. At $\eta = 1/L = 1/6$ the factors are $2/3$ and $0$, so the rate is $2/3 = 1 - 1/\kappa$: slower, though the stiff coordinate converges in one step. From $x_0 = (1, 1)$ with $\eta = 1/4$: $x_1 = (1/2, -1/2)$, $x_2 = (1/4, 1/4)$. In `solve/` the interval would be `answer = "(0, 1/3)"`.

**One AdamW step.** $\theta_0 = 2$, $g_1 = -5$, $\eta = 1/10$, $\lambda = 1/2$, $\epsilon = 0$. Then $\hat m_1 = -5$, $\hat v_1 = 25$, the adaptive step is $-\eta \cdot (-5)/5 = +1/10$, and the decay is $-\eta\lambda\theta_0 = -1/10$. So $\theta_1 = 2 - 1/10 + 1/10 = 2$: this step's push upward and the decay cancel exactly.

## 4. The problem set

Write each answer in `solve/S-M10a.toml`; lettered parts are their own tables:

```toml
[q5.a]
answer = "(0, 1/5)"
[q10.a]
answer = "g/(1 - beta)"
[q14]
answer = "g*(1 - beta1^t)"
[q17]
proof = "S-M10a/q17.md"
```

Rates and steps are exact fractions; write $\beta$ as `beta`, $\beta_1$ as `beta1`, $\eta$ as `eta`, and intervals as `(a, b)`, `[a, b)`, or `[a, oo)`.

AdamW also decays the weights: $\theta_t = \theta_{t-1} - \eta \lambda \theta_{t-1} - \eta\, \hat m_t / (\sqrt{\hat v_t} + \epsilon)$.

**q14.** If every gradient equals the same $g$, give $m_t$. `[expr in g, beta1, t]`
