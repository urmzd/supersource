## Key Takeaways

- A **schedule** is a pure function from the step number to a learning rate, so a resumed run gets the same rate from the step count alone (`test_schedules_hit_their_corners`).
- **Warmup** ramps the rate linearly from 0 while Adam's second moment is still unreliable; **cosine decay** then lowers it smoothly to a floor at a fixed `total` (`test_hand_example_cosine`, `test_cosine_matches_hf`).
- **Warmup-stable-decay** holds the peak rate and decays only at the end, so one run can be stopped and annealed at any length (`test_hand_example_wsd`, `test_wsd_matches_hf`).
- The **Noam** schedule rises linearly and decays like $1/\sqrt{t}$, peaking at $(d_{\text{model}} \cdot \text{warmup})^{-1/2}$ (`test_noam_peak_and_inverse_sqrt_decay`).
- **Global-norm clipping** rescales all gradients by one factor when their joint norm exceeds a limit: it caps the step size and keeps the direction (`test_hand_example_clip`, `test_clip_is_global_and_in_place`).

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start M10.4              # stubs python/tinyllm/optim/schedule.py, contract alongside
ss tests M10.4              # read the test catalog first: rung R0, you write no tests here
ss check M10.4              # exit code is the verdict
ss diff  M10.4              # after passing: your code against the reference
```

## 1. Why now

With `M10.3` your optimizer takes steps of about $\eta$ per coordinate, but it takes them with the same $\eta$ from the first step to the last. That fails at both ends. At step 1, Adam's second moment has seen one gradient, so its normalization is noisy, and a full-size step from random initial weights can push a Transformer into a region it never recovers from (the loss jumps and stays high). At the end, a constant rate keeps the weights bouncing around the minimum at a distance proportional to $\eta$, and the loss stops falling. The fix is a **schedule**: start small, run at the peak, end small. A second failure is a single bad batch: one gradient a thousand times larger than usual, common in recurrent networks (`L3.6`), which a normalized optimizer still follows for a step and momentum for many more. **Gradient clipping** bounds it. `L0.5` builds the train loop next; it calls a schedule before every step and clips before every update, and the `C1` training spec names both (`schedule.name = "wsd"`, `grad_clip = 1.0`).

## 2. Principles

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $t$ | the step: the number of optimizer updates already taken, 0 for the first | `int`, `step` |
| $\eta(t)$ | the learning rate used for update number $t + 1$ | `float` |
| $\eta_{\max}, \eta_{\min}$ | the peak rate and the floor | `float`, `lr_max`, `lr_min` |
| $W$ | warmup length in steps | `int`, `warmup` |
| $T$ | the step at which the cosine reaches the floor | `int`, `total` |
| $S, D$ | WSD's stable and decay lengths | `int`, `stable`, `decay` |
| $p$ | progress through a phase, in $[0, 1]$ | `float` |
| $d_{\text{model}}$ | the Transformer's model width (Noam) | `int` |
| $g^{(i)}$ | the gradient of parameter tensor $i$ | ndarray, `p.grad` |
| $\lVert g \rVert$ | the global norm, $\sqrt{\sum_i \sum_k (g^{(i)}_k)^2}$ | `float` |
| $c$ | the clipping limit | `float`, `max_norm` |

### 2.1 A schedule is a function of the step

The train loop (`L0.5`) does `opt.lr = schedule(t, ...)` and then `opt.step()`, for $t = 0, 1, 2, \dots$ Because the rate depends only on $t$ and the configuration, a run resumed from a checkpoint at step 5000 recomputes exactly the rate it would have used: no scheduler object has to be saved. The step is the number of updates **already taken**, the convention of HF's `LambdaLR` schedulers, so your values equal HF's when read the same way. Every warmup ramps linearly from 0: $\eta(t) = \eta_{\max}\, t / W$ for $t < W$. Update 1 therefore runs at rate 0 and changes nothing except the optimizer's moments, which is harmless and keeps the formulas exact at the phase boundaries.

### 2.2 Cosine decay with warmup

After warmup, the rate follows half a period of a cosine from $\eta_{\max}$ down to $\eta_{\min}$:

$$\eta(t) = \eta_{\min} + (\eta_{\max} - \eta_{\min})\, \frac{1 + \cos(\pi p)}{2}, \qquad p = \frac{t - W}{T - W}, \qquad W \le t \le T,$$

and $\eta(t) = \eta_{\min}$ for $t \ge T$. At $p = 0$, $\cos 0 = 1$ gives $\eta_{\max}$; at $p = 1$, $\cos \pi = -1$ gives $\eta_{\min}$; at $p = 1/2$ the rate is halfway. The curve is flat at both ends (its derivative in $p$ is $-\frac{\pi}{2}(\eta_{\max} - \eta_{\min}) \sin(\pi p)$, zero at $p = 0$ and $p = 1$), so the peak lasts a while and the final steps change the weights very little. The weakness is $T$: it must be fixed before training starts, and stopping early leaves the rate high.

### 2.3 Warmup, stable, decay

WSD (warmup-stable-decay, used by MiniCPM and many recent models) splits the run into three phases: the linear warmup over $W$ steps, a **stable** phase at $\eta_{\max}$ for $S$ steps, and a short **decay** over the last $D$ steps, here a straight line:

$$\eta(t) = \eta_{\max} - (\eta_{\max} - \eta_{\min})\, p, \qquad p = \frac{t - W - S}{D}, \qquad W + S \le t < W + S + D,$$

and $\eta_{\min}$ from $t = W + S + D$ on. The stable phase can be extended at will, and a decay can branch off any stable checkpoint, so one long run yields models at many lengths. Most of the loss improvement of a WSD run arrives during the short decay, which `C1` lets you see in its loss curve. (HF's `get_wsd_schedule` with a floor starts its warmup at the floor instead of 0; yours starts at 0 like the cosine, and the tests compare with HF from the end of warmup on.)

### 2.4 The Noam schedule

The 2017 Transformer used

$$\eta(t) = d_{\text{model}}^{-1/2} \cdot \min\!\left(t^{-1/2},\ t \cdot W^{-3/2}\right).$$

For $t < W$ the second term is smaller (because $t \cdot W^{-3/2} < t^{-1/2}$ exactly when $t^{3/2} < W^{3/2}$), so the rate grows linearly; for $t > W$ it decays like $1/\sqrt{t}$. The two meet at $t = W$, where $\eta = d_{\text{model}}^{-1/2} W^{-1/2} = (d_{\text{model}} W)^{-1/2}$, the peak. At $t = 0$ the formula reads $\min(\infty, 0) = 0$, and that is the value to return: Python raises `ZeroDivisionError` on `0 ** -0.5`. The factor $d_{\text{model}}^{-1/2}$ ties the peak to the width: wider models get smaller rates. `L5.5` trains with $d_{\text{model}} = 512$, $W = 4000$: peak $\approx 6.99 \times 10^{-4}$.

### 2.5 Clipping by the global norm

Treat all gradients of the model as one long vector and take its Euclidean length, the **global norm** $\lVert g \rVert$. If it exceeds the limit $c$, scale every gradient by the same factor:

$$g^{(i)} \leftarrow g^{(i)} \cdot \min\!\left(1,\ \frac{c}{\lVert g \rVert + 10^{-6}}\right).$$

One factor for all tensors keeps the direction of the full gradient and only shortens it, so the clipped step is still a descent direction; clipping each tensor separately would change the direction. The $10^{-6}$ is torch's guard against dividing by a zero norm. Clipping never scales up: below the limit, the gradients are untouched. The function returns the norm **before** clipping, which the train loop logs: a norm that keeps hitting the limit is the first sign of an unstable run. If the norm is infinite or NaN (an overflow, common under fp16 in `L11.1`), clipping cannot repair it, so the gradients are left alone and the caller skips the update. With Adam (`M10.3`), clipping matters less for the step size, since Adam normalizes per coordinate, but it still bounds what one outlier batch writes into $m$ and $v$.

## 3. Worked example by hand

**Cosine**, $W = 2$, $T = 6$, $\eta_{\max} = 1$, $\eta_{\min} = 0.1$:

| $t$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| phase | warmup | warmup | $p = 0$ | $p = 1/4$ | $p = 1/2$ | $p = 3/4$ | $p = 1$ | after |
| $\eta(t)$ | 0 | 0.5 | 1 | $0.1 + 0.9 \cdot \frac{1 + \cos(\pi/4)}{2} \approx 0.86820$ | 0.55 | $0.1 + 0.9 \cdot \frac{1 - \cos(\pi/4)}{2} \approx 0.23180$ | 0.1 | 0.1 |

This is the first test, `test_hand_example_cosine`.

**WSD**, $W = 2$, $S = 2$, $D = 4$, $\eta_{\max} = 1$, $\eta_{\min} = 0.2$: steps 0 and 1 ramp (0, 0.5); steps 2 and 3 are stable (1, 1); the decay runs from step 4 ($p = 0$: 1) through steps 5, 6, 7 ($p = 1/4, 1/2, 3/4$: 0.8, 0.6, 0.4); step 8 and after are at the floor, 0.2 (`test_hand_example_wsd`).

**Noam**, $d_{\text{model}} = 4$, $W = 4$, so $d^{-1/2} = 1/2$ and $W^{-3/2} = 1/8$: $\eta(0) = 0$; $\eta(1) = \frac12 \min(1, \frac18) = \frac1{16}$; $\eta(2) = \frac12 \min(0.707, \frac14) = \frac18$; $\eta(4) = \frac12 \min(\frac12, \frac12) = \frac14$, the peak $(4 \cdot 4)^{-1/2}$; $\eta(16) = \frac12 \cdot \frac14 = \frac18$, half the peak at four times the step (`test_hand_example_noam`).

**Clipping**: two tensors with gradients $[3, 4]$ and $[12]$. $\lVert g \rVert = \sqrt{9 + 16 + 144} = \sqrt{169} = 13$. With $c = 6.5$ the factor is $6.5 / 13.000001 \approx 0.49999996$, so the gradients become about $[1.5, 2]$ and $[6]$, and the call returns 13 (`test_hand_example_clip`).

## 4. The interface

```python
def cosine_with_warmup(step: int, warmup: int, total: int, lr_max: float, lr_min: float) -> float
def wsd(step: int, warmup: int, stable: int, decay: int, lr_max: float, lr_min: float) -> float
def noam(step: int, d_model: int, warmup: int) -> float
def clip_grad_norm_(params, max_norm: float) -> float   # in place; returns the norm before clipping
```

`params` is any iterable of objects with a `grad` attribute (an ndarray or `None`), the same parameters `M10.3` steps. The schedules raise `ValueError` for a negative step, a warmup longer than `total`, a zero decay length, or `lr_min` outside $[0, \eta_{\max}]$; `clip_grad_norm_` raises it for `max_norm <= 0`. The trailing underscore follows torch: the function changes its argument in place.

### What the tests check

| Test | KIND | Checks | Why it matters downstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test_hand_example_cosine` | unit | section 3's cosine row, steps 0 to 7 | you and the tests agree on the step convention |
| `test_hand_example_wsd` | unit | section 3's WSD values, steps 0 to 9 | the `C1` schedule |
| `test_hand_example_noam` | unit | section 3's Noam values | the `L5.5` schedule |
| `test_hand_example_clip` | unit | norm 13 clipped to 6.5 | the train loop's clip |
| `test_cosine_matches_hf` | golden | HF's cosine schedules (with and without a floor and warmup) at every step | comparability with HF-trained baselines |
| `test_wsd_matches_hf` | golden | HF's linear WSD, including steps past the end | same |
| `test_clip_matches_torch` | golden | `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_` on four gradient sets, including `None` and float32 | same clip as every reference run |
| `test_schedules_hit_their_corners` | property | over random configurations: peak exactly at the end of warmup, never above it, never rising after it, never below the floor, the floor from the end on | every phase-boundary off-by-one |
| `test_cosine_after_total_stays_at_floor` | boundary | steps past `total` | runs that train a little longer than planned |
| `test_noam_peak_and_inverse_sqrt_decay` | property | peak $(d W)^{-1/2}$ at $t = W$; $\eta\sqrt{t}$ constant after it; linear before | the 2017 recipe |
| `test_noam_step_zero_is_zero` | boundary | `noam(0, ...) == 0.0` with no exception | the first update |
| `test_clip_below_max_is_a_no_op` | boundary | small gradients unchanged bit for bit | clipping only shrinks |
| `test_clip_is_global_and_in_place` | property | one factor for all tensors; the norm after is `max_norm`; the arrays are the same objects | the direction is kept; the optimizer sees the change |
| `test_clip_nonfinite_norm_leaves_grads` | boundary | an `inf` gradient returns `inf` and changes nothing | `L11.1` skips overflowed steps |
| `test_clip_skips_missing_grads` | boundary | `grad = None` is skipped and stays `None`; no grads gives 0 | unused parameters |
| `test_rejects_bad_arguments` | boundary | impossible configurations raise `ValueError` | errors at the first step, not a rising "decay" |

## 5. Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Caught by |
|---|---|---|
| decaying to 0 and ignoring `lr_min` | the last part of the run does nothing; WSD and cosine runs end at different floors | `test_hand_example_cosine`, `test_cosine_matches_hf` (mutant `s01`) |
| measuring cosine progress over `total` instead of `total - warmup` | the floor is never reached; the rate at `total` is above `lr_min` | `test_cosine_matches_hf` (mutant `s02`) |
| warmup from `step + 1` | the rate reaches the peak one step early and every value differs from HF | `test_hand_example_cosine` (mutant `s03`) |
| letting the cosine run past `total` | the rate climbs back toward `lr_max` after the planned end | `test_cosine_after_total_stays_at_floor` (mutant `s04`) |
| counting WSD's stable phase from step 0 | the decay starts `warmup` steps early | `test_hand_example_wsd` (mutant `s05`) |
| evaluating Noam's formula at step 0 | `ZeroDivisionError` on the first update | `test_noam_step_zero_is_zero` (mutant `s08`) |
| clipping each tensor by its own norm | the update direction changes; small layers are never clipped while large ones always are | `test_clip_is_global_and_in_place` (mutant `s11`) |
| scaling small gradients up to `max_norm` | every step has the same length; early training diverges | `test_clip_below_max_is_a_no_op` (mutant `s12`) |
| clipping an infinite norm | `max_norm / inf = 0` zeroes the update and the overflow goes unnoticed | `test_clip_nonfinite_norm_leaves_grads` (mutant `s15`) |

## 6. Where it's used next
| Forward | `L11.1` | Registered call site uses this module. |
| Forward | `L6.1` | Registered call site uses this module. |

| Direction | Module | How it uses this |
|---|---|---|
| Back | `M00.3` | sequences and the geometric sum; the warmup is an arithmetic sequence (reading) |
| Back | `M10.2` | the optimizer protocol; a schedule writes `opt.lr` (reading) |
| Forward | `L0.5` | `train_step(..., clip=...)` clips, then the loop sets `opt.lr` from the spec's schedule and steps |
| Forward | `M10.3` | AdamW reads `opt.lr` on every step, and its decay scales with it |
| Forward | `L3.6` | clipping keeps truncated backpropagation through time stable |
| Forward | `L5.5` | the Noam schedule for the 2017 Transformer |
| Forward | `C1` | WSD with `decay_frac` and `grad_clip = 1.0` from `formats/train-spec.schema.json` |

If you skip this module, `ss check L0.5` stops with `BLOCKED ... needs M10.4`: build it, or pass `--ref-deps`.
