## Key Takeaways

- **Adam** keeps two exponential moving averages per coordinate, $m$ of the gradient and $v$ of its square, and moves each coordinate by $\eta\, \hat m / (\sqrt{\hat v} + \epsilon)$ (`test_hand_example_two_steps`, `test_matches_torch_adamw_trajectory`).
- **Bias correction** divides $m_t$ by $1 - \beta_1^t$ and $v_t$ by $1 - \beta_2^t$, which undoes the pull toward the zero they start from; the first step is then exactly $\eta$ per coordinate (`test_first_step_moves_each_coordinate_by_lr`).
- Dividing by $\sqrt{\hat v}$ makes the update **invariant to the scale of the gradient**, so one learning rate serves layers whose gradients differ by orders of magnitude (`test_update_ignores_gradient_scale`).
- **AdamW decouples weight decay**: it multiplies the weights by $1 - \eta\lambda$ instead of adding $\lambda w$ to the gradient, where Adam's normalization would wash the penalty out (`test_decoupled_decay_with_zero_gradient`).
- The optimizer **state is part of the model**: a save and load between steps must reproduce the uninterrupted run bit for bit (`test_resume_is_bitwise`).

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start M10.3              # stubs python/tinyllm/optim/adamw.py, contract alongside
ss tests M10.3              # read the test catalog first: rung R0, you write no tests here
ss check M10.3              # exit code is the verdict
ss diff  M10.3              # after passing: your code against the reference

## 1. Why now

Your training loop does not exist yet. `L0.5` builds it next, and it needs an optimizer that trains every model in the course without retuning: a bigram table, a 64-unit MLP on digits, an LSTM, a Transformer, and the 10M-parameter Llama-style model of `C1`. Plain SGD with momentum (`M10.2`) needs a learning rate tuned per model, and inside one model it is too slow for layers with small gradients and unstable for layers with large ones: an embedding row that sees a rare token gets a gradient a thousand times smaller than a layer norm gain. Adam fixes this by rescaling each coordinate by its own gradient history, and AdamW is the version every modern language model trains with. The `C1` training spec defaults to `adamw` with betas `(0.9, 0.95)`, and the checkpoint format already reserves `exp_avg` and `exp_avg_sq` for its state, so `dur.11` can kill a training worker and resume it. This module builds that optimizer and proves it equals `torch.optim.AdamW` step for step.

## 2. Principles

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $w$ | one parameter tensor (the optimizer treats each coordinate the same way) | `float32[...]`, `p.data` |
| $g_t$ | the gradient of the loss with respect to $w$ at step $t$ | same shape as $w$, `p.grad` |
| $t$ | the step counter: 1 for the first update | `int` |
| $\eta$ | the learning rate, read on every step | `float`, `opt.lr` |
| $\beta_1, \beta_2$ | decay rates of the two moving averages, in $[0, 1)$ | `float`, `opt.betas` |
| $m_t$ | first moment: moving average of $g$ | same shape as $w$, `exp_avg` |
| $v_t$ | second moment: moving average of $g^2$ (elementwise) | same shape as $w$, `exp_avg_sq` |
| $\hat m_t, \hat v_t$ | bias-corrected moments, $m_t / (1 - \beta_1^t)$ and $v_t / (1 - \beta_2^t)$ | same shape as $w$ |
| $\epsilon$ | a small constant that keeps the denominator away from 0 | `float`, default $10^{-8}$ |
| $\lambda$ | the weight decay coefficient | `float`, `opt.weight_decay` |

All operations on vectors are **elementwise**: $g^2$ squares each coordinate, $\sqrt{v}$ takes each square root, and $m / \sqrt{v}$ divides coordinate by coordinate.

### 2.1 Moving averages of the gradient

Gradient descent moves $w$ against the gradient: $w \leftarrow w - \eta\, g_t$. A minibatch gradient is noisy, and its direction changes from step to step. Momentum (`M10.2`) smooths it with an **exponential moving average** (EMA, `M02.2`):

$$m_t = \beta_1\, m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1)\, g_t, \qquad m_0 = 0 .$$

Unrolling the recursion shows what $m_t$ is: a weighted sum of all past gradients with geometrically decaying weights, $m_t = (1 - \beta_1) \sum_{s=1}^{t} \beta_1^{t-s} g_s$. With $\beta_1 = 0.9$ the last 10 or so steps carry most of the weight. Adam keeps a second EMA, of the squared gradient:

$$v_t = \beta_2\, v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2)\, g_t^2, \qquad v_0 = 0 .$$

With $\beta_2 = 0.999$ it remembers about 1000 steps. $v_t$ estimates $\mathbb{E}[g^2]$, the mean squared size of this coordinate's gradient.

### 2.2 Normalizing by the second moment

Adam's update divides the first moment by the square root of the second:

$$w_t = w_{t-1} - \eta\, \frac{\hat m_t}{\sqrt{\hat v_t} + \epsilon} .$$

$\sqrt{\hat v_t}$ has the units of the gradient, so the ratio $\hat m_t / \sqrt{\hat v_t}$ has no units: multiplying every gradient by a constant $c > 0$ multiplies both $\hat m_t$ and $\sqrt{\hat v_t}$ by $c$ and leaves the update unchanged (when $\epsilon$ is negligible). Each coordinate's step is therefore about $\eta$ in size when its gradient keeps a consistent sign, and smaller when the sign flips (then $|\hat m| \ll \sqrt{\hat v}$, because positive and negative gradients cancel in $m$ but not in $v$). The learning rate becomes a step length in parameter space, which is why one value such as $3 \times 10^{-4}$ works across many models. $\epsilon$ only matters when $\sqrt{\hat v}$ is near or below it, for coordinates whose gradients are almost always zero.

### 2.3 Bias correction

Both averages start at 0, so early on they are too small. Take every $g_s$ equal to the same value $g$. Then $m_t = (1 - \beta_1)\, g \sum_{s=0}^{t-1} \beta_1^{s} = (1 - \beta_1^t)\, g$ by the geometric sum (`M00.3`). The average is short of $g$ by exactly the factor $1 - \beta_1^t$, and dividing by it removes the bias:

$$\hat m_t = \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t}, \qquad \hat v_t = \frac{v_t}{1 - \beta_2^t} .$$

For random gradients with constant mean the same argument holds in expectation. The factor matters most for $v$: with $\beta_2 = 0.999$, $1 - \beta_2^{1} = 0.001$, so the uncorrected $v_1$ is 1000 times too small and the first step would be $\sqrt{1000} \approx 32$ times too large in the ratio $m / \sqrt{v}$ (partly offset by the uncorrected $m$, which is 10 times too small: net $3.16$ times too large). After a few thousand steps both factors are 1 and the correction disappears.

At $t = 1$ the corrections give $\hat m_1 = g_1$ and $\hat v_1 = g_1^2$, so the first update is $\eta\, g_1 / (|g_1| + \epsilon)$: exactly $\eta$ times the sign of $g_1$ when $\epsilon = 0$. torch folds the corrections into the step for speed, and you implement the same arrangement, because it decides where $\epsilon$ goes:

$$w_t = w_{t-1} - \frac{\eta}{1 - \beta_1^t}\cdot \frac{m_t}{\sqrt{v_t} / \sqrt{1 - \beta_2^t} + \epsilon} .$$

### 2.4 Decoupled weight decay

**Weight decay** shrinks the weights toward 0 a little on every step, which regularizes the model. For SGD it is the same as adding the penalty $\frac{\lambda}{2}\lVert w \rVert^2$ to the loss, whose gradient is $\lambda w$: the step $w - \eta(g + \lambda w) = (1 - \eta\lambda)\, w - \eta g$ decays $w$ by the factor $1 - \eta\lambda$.

For Adam the two are not the same. **Adam with L2** (`torch.optim.Adam(weight_decay=...)`) adds $\lambda w$ to $g$ before both moments see it, and then the normalization divides it by $\sqrt{\hat v}$: a coordinate with large gradients gets almost no decay, and with $g = 0$ the penalty itself becomes a normalized step of size $\eta$, whatever the weight's size. **AdamW** applies the decay directly to the weights, before the Adam update, and leaves the gradient alone:

$$w \leftarrow (1 - \eta\lambda)\, w, \quad \text{then the Adam step on } g_t .$$

Every coordinate shrinks by the same factor, as intended. The decay is scaled by $\eta$, so a schedule (`M10.4`) that lowers $\eta$ lowers the decay with it. Parameters whose gradient is `None` (the loss did not reach them this step) are skipped entirely: no decay, no moment update.

### 2.5 Saving and restoring the state

The optimizer state is $t$, $m$, and $v$ for every parameter, plus the hyperparameters. Training that stops and resumes (`dur.11` kills workers on purpose) must continue as if it never stopped, so `state_dict` returns **copies** of everything, and `load_state_dict` restores all of it, including $t$: with $t$ reset to 0 the bias correction would restart and the next step would be far too large. `formats/checkpoint.md` writes the moments as `<name>.exp_avg` and `<name>.exp_avg_sq`, in the parameter's dtype.

## 3. Worked example by hand

One scalar parameter $x_0 = 1$, gradients $g_1 = 2$ then $g_2 = -1$ (given, not computed from a loss), $\eta = 0.1$, $\beta_1 = 0.9$, $\beta_2 = 0.999$, $\epsilon = 0$, no weight decay.

| Step | $m_t$ | $v_t$ | $1 - \beta_1^t$ | $1 - \beta_2^t$ | $\hat m_t$ | $\hat v_t$ | update $\eta \hat m / \sqrt{\hat v}$ | $x_t$ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $0.1 \cdot 2 = 0.2$ | $0.001 \cdot 4 = 0.004$ | $0.1$ | $0.001$ | $2$ | $4$ | $0.1 \cdot 2 / 2 = 0.1$ | $0.9$ |
| 2 | $0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot (-1) = 0.08$ | $0.999 \cdot 0.004 + 0.001 \cdot 1 = 0.004996$ | $0.19$ | $0.001999$ | $8/19 \approx 0.42105$ | $4996/1999 \approx 2.49925$ | $0.1 \cdot 0.42105 / 1.58090 \approx 0.026634$ | $\approx 0.873366$ |

Two things to see. Step 1 moves by exactly $\eta = 0.1$: that is bias correction at work (without it, $0.1 \cdot 0.2 / \sqrt{0.004} \approx 0.316$). Step 2 has a negative gradient, yet $x$ keeps decreasing: $m$ still points the old way, and the step is smaller because $\hat v$ remembers the large first gradient. This is the first test, `test_hand_example_two_steps`.

**With weight decay $\lambda = 0.1$.** AdamW first multiplies $x$ by $1 - \eta\lambda = 0.99$: step 1 gives $0.99 - 0.1 = 0.89$; step 2 gives $0.89 \cdot 0.99 - 0.026634 \approx 0.854466$. Adam with L2 instead feeds $g_1 + \lambda x_0 = 2.1$ and $g_2 + \lambda x_1 = -1 + 0.09 = -0.91$ to the moments: step 1 still moves by exactly $0.1$ (the first step is $\eta$ times a sign, whatever the gradient), to $0.9$; step 2 lands at $\approx 0.868123$. The penalty changed $x_2$ by $0.0052$ under L2 and by $0.0189$ under AdamW (`test_hand_example_adamw_and_adam_l2_differ`).

## 4. The interface

```python
class Adam:
    lr: float; betas: tuple[float, float]; eps: float; weight_decay: float
    def __init__(self, params, lr=1e-3, betas=(0.9, 0.999), eps=1e-8, weight_decay=0.0) -> None
    def step(self) -> None             # one update of every p whose grad is not None, in place
    def zero_grad(self) -> None        # every p.grad = None
    def state_dict(self) -> dict       # {"step", "lr", "betas", "eps", "weight_decay", "exp_avg": [...], "exp_avg_sq": [...]}
    def load_state_dict(self, sd: dict) -> None

class AdamW(Adam):                     # decoupled decay; weight_decay defaults to 0.01
    def __init__(self, params, lr=1e-3, betas=(0.9, 0.999), eps=1e-8, weight_decay=0.01) -> None
```

A parameter is any object with `data` (a float ndarray) and `grad` (an ndarray or `None`); the tests use a two-attribute class, and `L0.5` passes autograd tensors (`L0.1`). The step counter $t$ is one global count of `step()` calls, as `formats/checkpoint.md` stores one step. torch keeps a counter per parameter instead; the two agree whenever every parameter has a gradient on every step, which is how the course trains. A schedule changes the learning rate by assigning `opt.lr` before `step()`.

### What the tests check

| Test | KIND | Checks | Why it matters downstream |

| `test_state_dict_layout` | unit | keys, shapes, hyperparameters restored, mismatches rejected | `formats/checkpoint.md` |
| `test_rejects_bad_hyperparameters` | boundary | negative lr, eps, or decay, a beta outside $[0, 1)$, no parameters, integer data | errors at construction, not NaN at step 9000 |

## 5. Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Caught by |
|---|---|---|
| no bias correction, or correcting only one moment | the first steps are about 3 times too large (or too small); early loss spikes | `test_first_step_moves_each_coordinate_by_lr`, `test_hand_example_two_steps` (mutants `s01`, `s03`) |
| counting $t$ from 0 inside the correction, or using $t + 1$ | $1 - \beta^0 = 0$ divides by zero, or every step is mis-scaled | `test_hand_example_two_steps` (mutant `s02`) |
| AdamW adding $\lambda w$ to the gradient | AdamW behaves like Adam with L2: decay is normalized away for large-gradient weights | `test_decoupled_decay_with_zero_gradient`, `test_hand_example_adamw_and_adam_l2_differ` (mutant `s05`) |
| decaying by $1 - \lambda$ instead of $1 - \eta\lambda$ | with $\lambda = 0.1$ the weights lose 10% per step and collapse toward 0 | `test_matches_torch_adamw_trajectory` (mutant `s06`) |
| $\epsilon$ inside the square root, or before the correction | rare-feature coordinates take steps of the wrong size; only visible when gradients are near $\epsilon$ | `test_eps_is_added_after_bias_correction` (mutants `s08`, `s14`) |
| caching the learning rate at construction | the schedule (`M10.4`) is silently ignored | `test_lr_set_between_steps_is_used` (mutant `s13`) |
| `p.data = p.data - ...` instead of `p.data -= ...` | the optimizer updates a copy; the model keeps its old weights | `test_update_is_in_place` (mutant `s16`) |
| returning live arrays from `state_dict`, or not restoring $t$ | a resumed run differs from the uninterrupted one; bias correction restarts after every resume | `test_state_dict_is_a_snapshot`, `test_resume_is_bitwise` (mutants `s19`, `s22`) |
| decaying parameters whose grad is `None` | embeddings of tokens absent from the batch shrink anyway | `test_parameter_without_grad_is_untouched` (mutant `s07`) |

## 6. Where it's used next

| Forward | `L12.1` | supervised fine-tuning |

If you skip this module, `ss check L0.5` stops with `BLOCKED ... needs M10.3`: build it, or pass `--ref-deps`.
