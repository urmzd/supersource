## Key Takeaways

- On an $L$-smooth, $\mu$-strongly convex function, gradient descent with step $1/L$ shrinks the optimality gap by at least $1 - 1/\kappa$ per step, where $\kappa = L/\mu$ is the condition number (`test_rate_on_quadratics`).
- On a quadratic, each eigen-direction is multiplied by $1 - \eta\lambda_i$ per step, so the iteration converges exactly when $0 < \eta < 2/L$ and blows up beyond it (`test_hand_example`, `test_divergence_raises`).
- Backtracking with the Armijo condition finds a step that decreases $f$ enough without knowing $L$, and returns the first acceptable step of $\alpha_0, \rho\alpha_0, \rho^2\alpha_0, \dots$ (`test_armijo_returns_the_first_acceptable_step`).
- Numerical edge cases are part of the algorithm: a NaN trial value must be rejected, and a direction that does not descend must be refused (`test_armijo_rejects_nan_steps`, `test_armijo_needs_a_descent_direction`).

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start M10.1              # stubs gd.py into your repo, contract alongside
ss tests M10.1              # read the test catalog first: rung R0, you write no tests here

## 1. Why now

In `L0.5` your bigram stops being a table of counts and becomes 65536 weights trained by your own autograd, and the first decision is the learning rate. Too large and the loss jumps to `inf`, then NaN, within a few steps; too small and it crawls for thousands of steps toward the count model's NLL that `L0.0` reached instantly. Both symptoms have exact explanations on a quadratic, the local model of every smooth loss: the step must stay under $2/L$, and the number of steps scales with the condition number $\kappa$. This module builds plain gradient descent and a line search, proves their rates on functions where the theory is exact, and gives `M10.2`'s optimizer protocol the update it generalizes.

## 2. Principles

| Symbol | Meaning | Type / shape |
|---|---|---|
| $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ | the function to minimize (a loss) | callable |
| $\nabla f(x)$ | its gradient at $x$ | `float64[n]` |
| $x^\star$, $f^\star$ | a minimizer and the minimum value | `float64[n]`, float |
| $\eta$ (`lr`) | the learning rate (step size) | float $> 0$ |
| $x_t$ | the iterate after $t$ steps | `float64[n]` |
| $L$ | smoothness constant: $\lVert\nabla f(x) - \nabla f(y)\rVert \le L \lVert x - y\rVert$ | float |
| $\mu$ | strong convexity constant | float $> 0$ |
| $\kappa = L/\mu$ | the condition number | float $\ge 1$ |
| $H$ | a symmetric positive definite matrix; for a quadratic, the Hessian | `float64[n, n]` |
| $\lambda_i$ | eigenvalues of $H$, with $\mu = \lambda_{\min}$ and $L = \lambda_{\max}$ | floats |
| $d$ | a search direction | `float64[n]` |
| $\alpha$, $\alpha_0$, $\rho$, $c$ | trial step, first trial, shrink factor, sufficient-decrease constant | floats |

**Convexity.** $f$ is convex if the chord between any two points of its graph lies above the graph: $f(\theta x + (1-\theta) y) \le \theta f(x) + (1-\theta) f(y)$ for $\theta \in [0, 1]$. For differentiable $f$ this is equivalent to every tangent plane lying below the graph:

$$f(y) \ge f(x) + \nabla f(x)^\top (y - x).$$

Then $\nabla f(x^\star) = 0$ implies $f(y) \ge f(x^\star)$ for all $y$: every stationary point is a global minimum. Neural network losses are not convex, but near a minimum they look like convex quadratics, and that is where the rates below describe what you see.

**Smoothness bounds the function from above.** If the gradient is $L$-Lipschitz, the function never curves up faster than a parabola of curvature $L$ (the descent lemma):

$$f(y) \le f(x) + \nabla f(x)^\top (y - x) + \tfrac L2 \lVert y - x\rVert^2.$$

**Strong convexity bounds it from below.** $f$ is $\mu$-strongly convex if $f(y) \ge f(x) + \nabla f(x)^\top (y - x) + \tfrac\mu2 \lVert y - x\rVert^2$: it curves up at least as fast as a parabola of curvature $\mu$. For a quadratic $f(x) = \tfrac12 x^\top H x$, the gradient is $Hx$, and the best constants are the extreme eigenvalues of $H$ (`M03.4`): $L = \lambda_{\max}$, $\mu = \lambda_{\min}$.

**The condition number.** $\kappa = L/\mu$ measures how stretched the level sets are: $\kappa = 1$ is a round bowl, $\kappa = 100$ is a long narrow valley. `M09.3` later defines the condition number of a matrix, $\lVert A\rVert \lVert A^{-1}\rVert$; for a symmetric positive definite $H$ it is the same $\lambda_{\max}/\lambda_{\min}$.

**Gradient descent and its rate.** The update is $x_{t+1} = x_t - \eta \nabla f(x_t)$. Put $y = x_{t+1}$ in the descent lemma with $\eta = 1/L$:

$$f(x_{t+1}) \le f(x_t) - \tfrac{1}{2L} \lVert\nabla f(x_t)\rVert^2.$$

Strong convexity implies $\lVert\nabla f(x)\rVert^2 \ge 2\mu\,(f(x) - f^\star)$ (minimize both sides of its defining inequality over $y$). Combining,

$$f(x_{t+1}) - f^\star \le \left(1 - \frac{\mu}{L}\right)\left(f(x_t) - f^\star\right) \quad\Rightarrow\quad f(x_t) - f^\star \le \left(1 - \frac1\kappa\right)^t \left(f(x_0) - f^\star\right).$$

To shrink the gap by a factor $\varepsilon$ takes about $\kappa \ln(1/\varepsilon)$ steps: ten times the condition number, ten times the steps.

**The quadratic, exactly.** For $f = \tfrac12 x^\top H x$, write $x$ in the eigenvectors of $H$. Gradient descent is then independent in each coordinate:

$$x_{t+1, i} = (1 - \eta \lambda_i)\, x_{t, i}.$$

The coordinate shrinks when $\lvert 1 - \eta\lambda_i\rvert < 1$, that is $0 < \eta < 2/\lambda_i$. For all coordinates at once: $0 < \eta < 2/L$. Above $2/L$ the stiffest direction grows by $\lvert 1 - \eta L\rvert > 1$ per step, which is the loss that jumps to `inf`. At $\eta = 1/L$ the stiffest direction is solved in one step and the flattest shrinks by $1 - 1/\kappa$: the bound above is attained.

**Line search: a step without knowing $L$.** Real losses do not announce $L$. Given a direction $d$ with $\nabla f(x)^\top d < 0$ (a descent direction, for example $d = -\nabla f(x)$), try $\alpha = \alpha_0$ and accept it if the **Armijo condition** holds:

$$f(x + \alpha d) \le f(x) + c\,\alpha\, \nabla f(x)^\top d, \qquad 0 < c < 1.$$

The right side is a line through $f(x)$ with a fraction $c$ of the initial slope; the step must land below it. Otherwise set $\alpha \leftarrow \rho\alpha$ and try again. For an $L$-smooth $f$ and $d = -\nabla f$, the descent lemma shows every $\alpha \le 2(1-c)/L$ is accepted, so backtracking stops after a bounded number of halvings with a step of at least $2\rho(1-c)/L$. If $d$ is not a descent direction, no small step helps, and the search must refuse instead of halving forever.

**NaN is a rejection.** A trial point outside the function's domain (a log of a negative number, an overflow) gives `nan`, and every comparison with NaN is false. Written as `if f(x + a d) <= bound: return a`, a NaN fails the test and the step shrinks. Written as `while f(x + a d) > bound: a *= rho`, the NaN makes the loop condition false and the bad step is accepted. Same math, opposite behavior.

## 3. Worked example by hand

**Gradient descent on $f(x) = \tfrac12(x_1^2 + 10 x_2^2)$.** $H = \mathrm{diag}(1, 10)$, so $\mu = 1$, $L = 10$, $\kappa = 10$, and $\nabla f = (x_1, 10 x_2)$. Start at $x_0 = (10, 1)$ with $\eta = 1/L = 0.1$:

| $t$ | $x_t$ | $\nabla f(x_t)$ | $f(x_t)$ | $f(x_t)/f(x_{t-1})$ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | $(10, 1)$ | $(10, 10)$ | 55 | |
| 1 | $(9, 0)$ | $(9, 0)$ | 40.5 | 0.736 |
| 2 | $(8.1, 0)$ | $(8.1, 0)$ | 32.805 | 0.81 |

The stiff coordinate is multiplied by $1 - 0.1 \cdot 10 = 0$ and is done in one step; the flat one by $1 - 0.1 \cdot 1 = 0.9$, so its share of $f$ shrinks by $0.81$ per step, inside the bound $1 - 1/\kappa = 0.9$. With $\eta = 0.21$, just over $2/L = 0.2$, the stiff coordinate is multiplied by $1 - 2.1 = -1.1$ per step: it alternates sign and grows without bound.

**One Armijo search** on $f(x) = x^2$ at $x = 1$ along $d = -f'(1) = -2$, with $\alpha_0 = 1$, $c = 10^{-4}$, $\rho = 0.5$. The slope is $f'(1)\,d = -4$.

| $\alpha$ | $x + \alpha d$ | $f$ | bound $1 + c\,\alpha\,(-4)$ | accept? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $-1$ | 1 | 0.9996 | no |
| 0.5 | 0 | 0 | 0.9998 | yes |

The full step overshoots to the mirror point with the same value; half of it lands on the minimum. The search returns 0.5.

These numbers are the first test case in section 4, `test_hand_example`.

## 4. The interface

```python
# python/tinyllm/optim/gd.py
def gradient_descent(f, grad, x0, lr: float, steps: int) -> list[NDArray]   # [x_0, ..., x_steps]
def armijo_step(f, grad, x, d, alpha0: float = 1.0, c: float = 1e-4, rho: float = 0.5) -> float
```

`gradient_descent` returns `steps + 1` independent float64 arrays and never modifies `x0`. It evaluates `f` at each iterate only to detect divergence: a non-finite value raises `FloatingPointError` naming the step. `armijo_step` raises `ValueError` for a non-descent direction or parameters outside $0 < c < 1$, $0 < \rho < 1$, $\alpha_0 > 0$, and `RuntimeError` after 60 reductions without success.

### What the tests check

| Test | KIND | Checks | Why it matters downstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test_hand_example` | unit | the section 3 trajectory and the Armijo search | you and the test agree on the update |
| `test_returns_every_iterate_as_copies` | unit | `steps + 1` independent arrays, `x0` untouched | trajectories are data you plot and compare |
| `test_rate_on_quadratics` | property | gap $\le (1 - 1/\kappa)^t$ at every step for $\kappa$ = 2, 10, 100 | the theorem behind learning-rate choices |
| `test_exact_rational_trajectory` | differential | equals an exact `fractions.Fraction` recomputation | the float trajectory is the math, to rounding |
| `test_divergence_raises` | boundary | $\eta = 3 > 2/L$ raises `FloatingPointError`; $\eta = 0.19$ converges | a diverging run fails loudly |
| `test_rejects_bad_arguments` | boundary | $\eta \le 0$ and negative steps are `ValueError` | caller bugs |
| `test_armijo_returns_the_first_acceptable_step` | property | the step satisfies the condition and twice it does not, on 50 Rosenbrock points | the largest acceptable step on the grid |
| `test_armijo_accepts_alpha0` | unit | a full step that works is returned unchanged | no needless shrinking |
| `test_armijo_rejects_nan_steps` | boundary | NaN trial values are rejected; the search returns 0.125 | functions with a restricted domain |
| `test_armijo_needs_a_descent_direction` | boundary | ascent and orthogonal directions, bad $c$, $\rho$, $\alpha_0$ raise | no infinite halving |
| `test_armijo_gives_up` | boundary | a lying gradient ends in `RuntimeError` | no infinite loop |
| `test_line_search_descends_rosenbrock` | property | 300 steepest-descent steps with Armijo decrease $f$ monotonically | a step size without knowing $L$ |

## 5. Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Caught by |
|---|---|---|
| 1. a learning rate above $2/L$ with no divergence check | a list of `inf` and NaN returned as a trajectory | `test_divergence_raises` (mutant `s05`) |
| 2. `while f(new) > bound` | a NaN trial point is accepted | `test_armijo_rejects_nan_steps` (mutant `s07`) |
| 3. searching along a direction that does not descend | halving forever, or accepting an ascent | `test_armijo_needs_a_descent_direction` (mutant `s08`) |
| 4. updating `x` in place and appending it | every entry of the trajectory is the final iterate; `x0` changes | `test_returns_every_iterate_as_copies` (mutants `s03`, `s04`) |
| 5. the sign of the step | gradient ascent | `test_hand_example` (mutant `s01`) |
| 6. the sign of the Armijo bound | steps that increase $f$ are accepted | `test_armijo_returns_the_first_acceptable_step` (mutant `s06`) |
| 7. shrinking once more after success | steps half as long as they could be | `test_armijo_accepts_alpha0` (mutant `s09`) |
| 8. returning a vanishing step instead of giving up | silent stalls at $\alpha = 10^{-18}$ | `test_armijo_gives_up` (mutant `s10`) |
| 9. leaving $x_0$ out of the trajectory | every index is off by one | `test_hand_example` (mutant `s02`) |

## 6. Where it's used next

| Direction | Module | How it uses this |
|---|---|---|
| Back | `M04.1` | gradients, and how to check them |
| Back | `M03.4` | the eigenvalues that give $L$, $\mu$, and $\kappa$ |
| Forward | `M10.2` | SGD with momentum 0 performs exactly this update, in place, behind the `Optimizer` protocol |
| Forward | `L0.5` | the bigram's learning rate and loss curve, read with $2/L$ and $\kappa$ |
| Forward | `M10.5` | the top Hessian eigenvalue during training, against the $2/\eta$ edge of stability |
| Forward | `M09.3` | the condition number of a matrix and of a problem |

If you skip this module, `ss check M10.2` stops with `M10.2 needs M10.1`: build it, or rerun with `--ref-deps`.
