## Key Takeaways

- Integration by parts is the product rule integrated; substitution is the chain rule integrated (q1 to q11, q12).
- The Gaussian integral $\int e^{-x^2} = \sqrt{\pi}$ gives the normal density its constant, and half the second moment of a standard normal sits on each side of 0, which is the ReLU factor in Kaiming initialization (q16, q17).
- A series converges when its partial sums do; terms going to 0 is necessary, not sufficient (q20, q30).
- A Taylor polynomial plus a Lagrange remainder is an approximation with a guarantee; range reduction keeps the remainder small (q35, q38).
- A first-order ODE describes a rate; the logistic equation's solution is the sigmoid, and Euler's method is one step of gradient descent on gradient flow (q48, q51, q52).

## How to work this chapter

```bash
ss start S-M02             # writes solve/S-M02.toml and the four proof files
ss check S-M02             # SymPy checks the answers, then asks each proof rubric (y/n)
ss check S-M02 --regrade   # ask the rubrics again after you change a proof
```

## 1. Why now

Your Pass 2 code leans on this calculus in three places. `M02.1` computes $e^x$ and $\operatorname{erf}$ from Taylor polynomials, and its tests check a Lagrange remainder bound; `M09.6` later puts the same polynomial in C. `M02.2` treats the exponential moving average as a geometric series and derives Adam's bias correction (`M10.3`) from its partial sum. And `M07.0` and `M07.3` draw normal random numbers and pick initialization scales from integrals of the normal density, which only exist because $\int e^{-x^2}$ converges to $\sqrt{\pi}$. This set checks the hand techniques behind those modules: integrating by parts and by substitution, improper integrals, convergence, Taylor remainders, curves, and the simplest differential equations.

| $h$ | the step size of Euler's method | positive real |

### 2.1 Integration techniques

**Substitution** reverses the chain rule: $\int f(g(x))\,g'(x)\,dx = \int f(u)\,du$ with $u = g(x)$; change the limits with it. **Integration by parts** reverses the product rule: $\int_a^b u v' = [uv]_a^b - \int_a^b u' v$; pick $u$ to get simpler when differentiated ($x$, $\ln x$). **Partial fractions** split a rational function into simple pieces: $\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{x - 1} - \frac{1}{x + 1}\right)$. **Trigonometric identities** such as $\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}$ and substitutions such as $x = 2\sin\theta$ remove square roots.

### 2.2 Improper integrals and the Gaussian

An integral over an infinite range, or of a function that blows up at an endpoint, is defined as a limit, and it **converges** when the limit is finite: $\int_1^\infty x^{-2} = 1$ but $\int_1^\infty x^{-1} = \infty$; $\int_0^1 x^{-1/2} = 2$ although the integrand is unbounded. The **Gaussian integral** $I = \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2} dx$ has no elementary antiderivative, but $I^2$ is a double integral over the plane, and in polar coordinates ($dx\,dy = r\,dr\,d\theta$) it becomes $\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\infty e^{-r^2} r\,dr\,d\theta = \pi$. Substituting $x = z/\sqrt{2}$ gives $\int e^{-z^2/2} dz = \sqrt{2\pi}$, the constant of the normal density. By symmetry, $\int_0^\infty z^2 \varphi(z)\,dz$ is half of $\int_{-\infty}^\infty z^2 \varphi(z)\,dz = 1$.

### 2.3 Series and convergence

A series $\sum a_n$ **converges** to $S$ when its partial sums $S_N \to S$. Tests: a **geometric** series $\sum_{n \ge 0} r^n = \frac{1}{1 - r}$ for $|r| < 1$; the **$p$-series** $\sum n^{-p}$ converges exactly for $p > 1$ (compare with $\int_1^\infty x^{-p}$, the **integral test**); the **ratio test** gives convergence when $|a_{n+1}/a_n| \to L < 1$; an **alternating** series with terms decreasing to 0 converges. A **power series** $\sum c_n x^n$ converges for $|x| < R$ and diverges for $|x| > R$; each endpoint $x = \pm R$ needs its own test.

### 2.4 Taylor polynomials and the remainder

$T_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} x^k$ matches $f$ and its first $n$ derivatives at 0. **Lagrange's form** of the remainder says $f(x) - T_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!} x^{n+1}$ for some $c$ between 0 and $x$, so a bound on $f^{(n+1)}$ bounds the error. The error grows like $|x|^{n+1}$, so implementations shrink $x$ first: **range reduction** writes $x = k\ln 2 + r$ with $|r| \le \frac{1}{2}\ln 2$ and computes $e^x = 2^k e^r$, where a degree 6 polynomial in $r$ already reaches float32 precision (`M02.1`, `M09.6`).

### 2.5 Parametric curves and polar coordinates

A curve $x(t), y(t)$ has slope $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y'(t)}{x'(t)}$ and arc length $\int \sqrt{x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2}\,dt$. In polar coordinates the area swept by $r(\theta)$ is $\int \frac{1}{2} r^2\,d\theta$, and multiplying an equation by $r$ converts it with $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$, $r\cos\theta = x$, $r\sin\theta = y$.

### 2.6 First-order differential equations

$y' = -k y$ has the solution $y(t) = y(0)\,e^{-kt}$ (separate variables: $dy/y = -k\,dt$). A **linear** equation $y' + p\,y = q(t)$ is solved with the integrating factor $e^{\int p}$. The **logistic** equation $y' = y(1 - y)$ separates by partial fractions and gives the sigmoid. **Euler's method** steps $y_{k+1} = y_k + h\,f(t_k, y_k)$. Gradient descent with learning rate $h$ is exactly Euler's method on the **gradient flow** $x' = -\nabla f(x)$, and `M02.4` shows momentum is Euler on the heavy-ball equation.

## 3. Worked example by hand

This is a sibling of q1 and q17, not one of the graded problems.

**By parts, twice.** Compute $\int_0^1 x^2 e^{-x}\,dx$. Take $u = x^2$, $v' = e^{-x}$, so $u' = 2x$, $v = -e^{-x}$: the integral is $[-x^2 e^{-x}]_0^1 + 2\int_0^1 x e^{-x}\,dx = -e^{-1} + 2\int_0^1 x e^{-x}\,dx$. Again with $u = x$: $\int_0^1 x e^{-x} = [-x e^{-x}]_0^1 + \int_0^1 e^{-x} = -e^{-1} + (1 - e^{-1}) = 1 - 2e^{-1}$. Total: $-e^{-1} + 2 - 4e^{-1} = 2 - 5e^{-1} \approx 0.1606$. In `solve/` this is `answer = "2 - 5*exp(-1)"`; `answer = "0.1606"` fails as inexact.

**A Gaussian moment.** $\mathbb{E}[|Z|] = 2\int_0^\infty z\,\varphi(z)\,dz$ for a standard normal $Z$. Substitute $u = z^2/2$, $du = z\,dz$: $\int_0^\infty z e^{-z^2/2} dz = \int_0^\infty e^{-u} du = 1$. So $\mathbb{E}[|Z|] = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = \sqrt{2/\pi} \approx 0.798$.

## 4. The problem set

Write each answer in `solve/S-M02.toml`:

```toml
[q3]
answer = "pi/2 - 1"
[q19]
answer = "true"
[q28]
answer = "[-1, 1)"
[q45]
answer = "x^2 + y^2 = 2*y"
[q12]
proof = "S-M02/q12.md"
```

Numbers are exact (`log(3/2)/2`, not `0.2027`). Taylor polynomials are checked symbolically, in any term order. Write $e$ as `E` or `exp(1)` and $\pi$ as `pi`.
