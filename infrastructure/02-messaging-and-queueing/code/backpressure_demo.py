"""Pull vs push: why a pull loop gives backpressure for free.

Standalone, no external deps:  python3 backpressure_demo.py

Model (Streamflow `orders`):
  - Producer offers messages at arrival rate lambda (msgs/tick).
  - One worker has a service rate mu (msgs/tick), mu < lambda (overload).

PUSH: the broker shoves `lambda` msgs/tick at the worker regardless of pace.
  The worker can only durably handle `mu`; the surplus has nowhere to live in
  the worker, so it is dropped (or, in a real push broker, buffered in an
  unbounded in-flight set until the worker OOMs / the broker's prefetch fills).

PULL: the worker calls poll() and only ever asks for what it can handle (`mu`).
  The unconsumed surplus stays *in the log* as a growing backlog (lag). Nothing
  is lost and nothing overwhelms the worker -- the backlog is the backpressure
  signal an autoscaler (KEDA, topic 01) reacts to.

We also show Little's Law (L = lambda * W) and that queue depth is the integral
of (arrival - service) over time.
