# Java Practice

Master JVM internals, generics, concurrency, and modern Java features.

## Language Essentials

| Concept | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Memory Model** | JVM GC (G1/ZGC), heap/stack, escape analysis, value types (Valhalla preview) |
| **Type System** | Strong static, generics (type erasure), sealed classes, records |
| **Error Handling** | Checked + unchecked exceptions, `Optional`, try-with-resources |
| **Concurrency** | Virtual threads (21+), `CompletableFuture`, `java.util.concurrent`, structured concurrency |
| **Build** | `gradle` or `maven`, `jshell` for REPL |
| **Standard** | Java 21+ LTS |

## Key Idioms

- **Records** for immutable data transfer objects
- **Sealed interfaces + pattern matching** (switch expressions)
- **Virtual threads** over thread pools for I/O-bound work
- **`Stream` API** for functional collection processing
- **Try-with-resources** for `AutoCloseable` cleanup
- **`Optional`** instead of null returns
- **`var`** for local variable type inference

## Practising these

```bash
practice/bin/ss list  build java          # which of these have references yet
practice/bin/ss start build java 01       # clone it stubbed into .scratchpad/
practice/bin/ss check build java 01       # run it; exit code is the verdict
practice/bin/ss diff  build java 01       # your attempt against the reference
```

Exercises are ordered by concept, not by difficulty, so pick by the stars rather
than by the number. An exercise listed below with no reference yet is a row in
this table and nothing more; see the [practice path](../../README.md) for how the
harness works.
