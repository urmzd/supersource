# Go Practice

Master goroutines, channels, interfaces, and simplicity-driven design.

## Language Essentials

| Concept | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Memory Model** | GC, stack-allocated by default, escape analysis, pointers but no arithmetic |
| **Type System** | Static, structural typing, interfaces (implicit), generics (1.18+) |
| **Error Handling** | `error` interface, multiple returns, `errors.Is`/`As`, no exceptions |
| **Concurrency** | Goroutines, channels, `select`, `sync` package, `context` cancellation |
| **Build** | `go build`, modules (`go.mod`), `go test`, `go vet` |
| **Standard** | Go 1.22+ |

## Key Idioms

- **Accept interfaces, return structs**
- **`if err != nil`** -- explicit error checking
- **Table-driven tests** with `testing` package
- **`context.Context`** threaded through call chains
- **Channel direction** in function signatures (`chan<-`, `<-chan`)
- **Embedding** for composition over inheritance
- **`defer`** for cleanup, runs LIFO

## Practising these

```bash
practice/bin/ss list  build go          # which of these have references yet
practice/bin/ss start build go 01       # clone it stubbed into .scratchpad/
practice/bin/ss check build go 01       # run it; exit code is the verdict
practice/bin/ss diff  build go 01       # your attempt against the reference
```

Exercises are ordered by concept, not by difficulty, so pick by the stars rather
than by the number. An exercise listed below with no reference yet is a row in
this table and nothing more; see the [practice path](../../README.md) for how the
harness works.
