# Scala Practice

> **Optional language.** Scala is not one of the languages this
> curriculum targets, so these exercises have no reference implementations
> yet and are excluded from `ss verify build` and from CI. They are kept
> because the exercises are worth doing, and every `ss` command works on
> them by name.
>
> Toolchain: `brew install scala-cli`. On a chezmoi-managed machine it comes from the
> `install_alt_langs` flag, which is off by default.
>
> `scala-cli` runs a bare directory of sources and manages its own JVM, so no build definition is needed.


Master functional programming, the type system, and pattern matching on the JVM.

## Language Essentials

| Concept | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Memory Model** | JVM GC, value classes, case classes (immutable by default) |
| **Type System** | Strong static, higher-kinded types, variance, path-dependent types |
| **Error Handling** | `Option`, `Either`, `Try`, `Future` recovery, no checked exceptions |
| **Concurrency** | `Future`/`Promise`, Akka actors, cats-effect IO, ZIO |
| **Build** | `sbt`, `scala-cli`, Mill |
| **Standard** | Scala 3 (Dotty) |

## Key Idioms

- **Case classes** for immutable data
- **Pattern matching** with exhaustiveness checking
- **For-comprehensions** for monadic composition
- **Implicits / given instances** (Scala 3) for type-class derivation
- **Sealed traits** for algebraic data types
- **Extension methods** (Scala 3) over implicit classes
- **Opaque types** for zero-cost newtype wrappers

- [Scala Standard Library](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/) -- API docs
- *Functional Programming in Scala* (Chiusano & Bjarnason) -- the red book

## Practising these

```bash
practice/bin/ss list  build scala          # which of these have references yet
practice/bin/ss start build scala 01       # clone it stubbed into .scratchpad/
practice/bin/ss check build scala 01       # run it; exit code is the verdict
practice/bin/ss diff  build scala 01       # your attempt against the reference
```

Exercises are ordered by concept, not by difficulty, so pick by the stars rather
than by the number. An exercise listed below with no reference yet is a row in
this table and nothing more; see the [practice path](../../../README.md) for how the
harness works.
