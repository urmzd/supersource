# Zig Practice

> **Optional language.** Zig is not one of the languages this
> curriculum targets, so these exercises have no reference implementations
> yet and are excluded from `ss verify build` and from CI. They are kept
> because the exercises are worth doing, and every `ss` command works on
> them by name.
>
> Toolchain: `brew install zig`. On a chezmoi-managed machine it comes from the
> `install_alt_langs` flag, which is off by default.
>
> Zig 0.16 removed `async`/`await` from the language, so exercise 06 as listed below needs redefining before it can be written.


Master comptime, explicit allocation, and zero-hidden-control-flow.

## Language Essentials

| Concept | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Memory Model** | Explicit allocators passed as params, no hidden allocations, `defer` cleanup |
| **Type System** | Strong static, comptime generics, optional types, error unions |
| **Error Handling** | Error unions (`!`), `try`, `catch`, error traces |
| **Concurrency** | `async`/`await` (stackless), `std.Thread`, no runtime |
| **Build** | `zig build`, build.zig (Zig-based build system), C interop out of box |
| **Standard** | Zig 0.13+ (pre-1.0 but stable API subset) |

## Key Idioms

- **Allocator parameter** on every function that allocates
- **`comptime`** for generics and compile-time code generation
- **`defer`/`errdefer`** for cleanup (like Go but with error awareness)
- **Sentinel-terminated slices** (`[:0]u8` for C strings)
- **`@import("std")`** -- single namespace, explicit imports
- **Tagged unions** for sum types
- **No hidden control flow** -- no operator overloading, no hidden allocations

## Practising these

```bash
practice/bin/ss list  build zig          # which of these have references yet
practice/bin/ss start build zig 01       # clone it stubbed into .scratchpad/
practice/bin/ss check build zig 01       # run it; exit code is the verdict
practice/bin/ss diff  build zig 01       # your attempt against the reference
```

Exercises are ordered by concept, not by difficulty, so pick by the stars rather
than by the number. An exercise listed below with no reference yet is a row in
this table and nothing more; see the [practice path](../../../README.md) for how the
harness works.

## Exercises

| # | Exercise | Concepts | Difficulty |

Exercise 02 (hash map) is consolidated into the course modules `ds.02` and `ds.05` ([Systems Data Structures](../../../../algorithms/16-systems-data-structures/)); the row had no reference.
