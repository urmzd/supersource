/* arena.h - a bump allocator.
 *
 * Given to you. Implement arena.c against it; main.c tests it.
 *
 * An arena hands out memory by moving a pointer forward and frees everything
 * at once. There is no per-allocation free, which is the entire point: you
 * give up individual lifetimes and get back an allocation that costs a few
 * instructions and a deallocation that costs one.
