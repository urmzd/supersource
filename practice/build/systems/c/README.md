# C Practice

Master manual memory management, pointer arithmetic, and undefined behavior avoidance.

## Language Essentials

| Concept | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Memory Model** | Manual allocation (`malloc`/`free`), stack vs heap, no GC |
| **Type System** | Weak static typing, implicit conversions, `void*` generics |
| **Error Handling** | Return codes, `errno`, `setjmp`/`longjmp` (avoid) |
| **Concurrency** | pthreads, atomics (`stdatomic.h`), no language-level async |
| **Build** | `gcc`/`clang`, `make`, `cmake`, header/source separation |
| **Standard** | C11 (prefer) or C17 |

## Key Idioms

- **Opaque pointers** for encapsulation (`struct Foo;` in header, definition in .c)
- **Goto cleanup** pattern for resource management
- **Flexible array members** for variable-length structs
- **Static inline** functions in headers for zero-cost abstractions
- **Compound literals** for temporary struct values
- **Designated initializers** for readable struct initialization

## Practising these

```bash
practice/bin/ss list  build c          # which of these have references yet
practice/bin/ss start build c 01       # clone it stubbed into .scratchpad/
practice/bin/ss check build c 01       # run it; exit code is the verdict
practice/bin/ss diff  build c 01       # your attempt against the reference
```

Exercises are ordered by concept, not by difficulty, so pick by the stars rather
than by the number. An exercise listed below with no reference yet is a row in
this table and nothing more; see the [practice path](../../../README.md) for how the
harness works.

## Exercises

Implement each using only the C standard library. No external dependencies.
