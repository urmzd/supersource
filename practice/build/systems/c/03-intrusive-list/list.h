/* list.h - an intrusive doubly-linked list, in the style the Linux kernel uses.
 *
 * Given to you, including the macros. Implement list.c against it; main.c
 * tests it.
 *
 * "Intrusive" means the list node lives INSIDE your struct, rather than the
 * list allocating a wrapper node that points at your struct:
 *
 *     typedef struct { int id; ListNode link; } Task;
 *
 * So linking a Task costs no allocation and cannot fail, and one struct can
 * sit on several lists at once by embedding several nodes. The price is that
 * you get back a ListNode * and have to recover the Task * yourself, which is
 * what container_of is for.

 * The subtraction is the whole trick: offsetof says how far `member` sits into
 * `type`, so backing up that far from the member lands on the struct. The
 * (char *) cast makes the arithmetic bytewise; without it the compiler scales
 * by the pointee's size and you land somewhere arbitrary.
 *
 * The `1 ? (ptr) : &(((type *)0)->member)` is a compile-time type check that
 * costs nothing at runtime: both arms of the conditional must have compatible
 * types, so passing a pointer to the wrong member fails to build instead of
