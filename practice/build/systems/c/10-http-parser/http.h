/* http.h - an incremental HTTP/1.1 request parser.
 *
 * Given to you. Implement http.c against it; main.c tests it.
 *
 * "Incremental" is the whole exercise. Bytes arrive from a socket in whatever
 * chunks the network felt like, with no relationship to message boundaries, so
 * the parser must be able to stop mid-header and resume when more arrives.
 * That is why it is a state machine and not a series of calls to strtok.
