// queue.hpp - a bounded, blocking, thread-safe queue.
//
// You write the marked regions. main.cpp tests them.
//
// This is the C++ counterpart to the C thread pool, and the interesting
// difference is that RAII does the lock management. There is no path through
// this file where a lock is taken and not released, including the paths where
// an exception is thrown, because unique_lock's destructor runs during
// unwinding.
