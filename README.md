Three distinct "distributed" problems kept apart on purpose: distributed **training** (parallelism — PyTorch/JAX, FSDP/ZeRO, Megatron, Ray Train; served with vLLM/TensorRT-LLM; plus embeddings and small language models), distributed **data** (sharding, replication, in-memory caching with Redis and cache-invalidation patterns, Cassandra, knowledge graphs via Apache AGE, OLAP vs OLTP), and distributed **orchestration** (durable execution and the worker pattern — Temporal/Cadence/DBOS — with distributed observability and profiling). Plus the connective tissue: gRPC and serialization, SSE token streaming, the coding/design patterns these systems are built from, production-grade **retrieval** (encoders, chunking, hybrid BM25 + vector + graph fusion, multimodal, metadata/permission filtering), **authorization** (RBAC/ABAC/NGAC and the pushdown-automata complexity ladder), **evaluation** (cross-entropy, perplexity, bits-per-byte, LLM-as-judge, RAG faithfulness), and **edge/realtime inference** (the end-to-end llama.cpp + GGUF local path, streaming speech encoders, and the efficiency architectures — sliding-window attention, GQA, MoE, Mamba/SSM — behind Mistral's models).

- **Combined Path** 40+ weeks, zero to Staff+ interview-ready
- **PhD Research Track** deep learning research + information theory + RL

## Role Paths

A [path](paths/) orders existing chapters for one job and says what "done" means at each stage; the tracks keep owning the content. Paths compose: six parts each stand alone for a narrower role, and **Superstar FDE** includes all six plus a capstone.

| Path | For |
|------|-----|
| [Superstar FDE](paths/superstar-fde/) | Forward deployed engineer at an inference and fine-tuning cloud, end to end: every part below plus a one-customer capstone |
| [LLM Foundations](paths/llm-foundations/) | History from n-grams to reasoning models, transformer math, architecture variants |
| [Frameworks and Models](paths/frameworks-and-models/) | PyTorch, JAX, Keras 3, and loading checkpoints from the Hugging Face Hub |
| [Training](paths/training/) | RL foundations, pretraining, post-training (SFT, DPO, GRPO), LoRA |
| [Inference Performance](paths/inference-performance/) | Engine internals, quantization, vLLM/SGLang serving and load testing |
| [AI Full Stack](paths/ai-full-stack/) | Streaming, retrieval, evaluation, routing |
| [Field Engineering](paths/field-engineering/) | Discovery, sizing, performance testing engagements, POCs, migration, commercials, escalation |

```bash
practice/bin/ss learn                        # every path and your progress
practice/bin/ss learn superstar-fde next     # read the next unfinished stage
```

## Read Offline (Single PDF)

The whole curriculum builds into one PDF -- every track and topic in learning
order, with the C4 architecture diagrams and Mermaid diagrams rendered inline.

- **From CI**: every run produces a `supersource-curriculum-pdf` build artifact.
- **From a release**: `supersource-curriculum.pdf` is attached to each GitHub Release, alongside one `supersource-<path>.pdf` per [role path](paths/).
- **Locally**:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/build-book.sh           # -> outputs/supersource-curriculum.pdf
  ./scripts/build-book.sh --path superstar-fde  # -> outputs/supersource-superstar-fde.pdf
  ./scripts/build-book.sh --help    # options (--skip-mermaid, --no-toc, ...)
  ```

  Requires `pandoc` and a LaTeX engine (`xelatex`). For full fidelity also
  install `librsvg` (embeds the C4 SVGs) and `mermaid-filter` (renders Mermaid);
  without them the build still succeeds with diagrams shown as code.

## Interviews

Company-specific guides for 19 companies. See [`interviews/README.md`](interviews/README.md).

- **Big Tech & AI Labs** [Anthropic](interviews/anthropic/), [Google](interviews/google/), [DeepMind](interviews/deepmind/), [OpenAI](interviews/openai/), [Meta](interviews/meta/), [Apple](interviews/apple/), [NVIDIA](interviews/nvidia/), [Moonshot](interviews/moonshot/)
- **Infrastructure & Data** [Netflix](interviews/netflix/), [Amazon](interviews/amazon/), [Databricks](interviews/databricks/), [Stripe](interviews/stripe/), [Palantir](interviews/palantir/)
- **Quant & Trading** [Jane Street](interviews/jane-street/), [Citadel](interviews/citadel/), [Two Sigma](interviews/two-sigma/), [HRT](interviews/hrt/), [Renaissance](interviews/renaissance-technologies/)
- **Frontier** [SpaceX](interviews/spacex/)

## Practice

The tracks above are the **learning path**: you read them. [`practice/`](practice/README.md) is the **practice path**: it tells you whether you actually know it. One CLI drives it, and everything you write goes to a gitignored `.scratchpad/`, never into the repo.

```bash
practice/bin/ss list                # every exercise, and which you have started
practice/bin/ss start predict go 01 # clone it into .scratchpad/ and open it
practice/bin/ss check predict go 01 # exit code is the verdict
```

Three kinds of exercise, distinguished only by what you produce:

| Kind | You produce | It is wrong when |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| [`predict`](practice/predict/) | The exact output you expect from a snippet | Your prediction differs from what ran |
| [`build`](practice/build/) | An implementation from scratch | The exercise's own assertions fail |
| [`reattempt`](practice/reattempt/) | A second solution to something you already solved | The original's assertions fail |

**[Predict-then-run](practice/predict/)** is the retention drill and the place to start: 24 snippets across Go, Rust, Python, and TypeScript where you write the exact expected output *before* running, and the diff tells you which part of your mental model is wrong. Every snippet is checked in CI for determinism, wall time, and peak memory.

**[Build](practice/build/)** is 10 graded exercises per language, covering data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and language-specific idioms. Each reference implementation is standard library only and passes its own assertions in CI.

| | Languages | Focus |
|---|-----------|-------|
| **Core** | [Go](practice/build/cloud/go/), [Rust](practice/build/systems/rust/), [Python](practice/build/general/python/), [TypeScript](practice/build/general/typescript/), [C](practice/build/systems/c/), [C++](practice/build/systems/cpp/) | What the curriculum targets, and what CI verifies |
| **Optional** | [Zig](practice/build/systems/zig/), [Scala](practice/build/cloud/scala/), [Java](practice/build/cloud/java/) | Worth doing, but not in use here; excluded from the default run |

### From-Scratch Implementations

- [K-Means Clustering](algorithms/14-ml-statistics/k-means.py) unsupervised learning
- [TF-IDF Vector Search](algorithms/14-ml-statistics/tf-idf-vector-search.py) text similarity search

## Case Studies

Real builds, generalized. Each takes a system designed under a deadline, strips it to the transferable concepts, and records the order it was actually assembled in. Every implementation is standard library only and runs its own tests: `python <file>.py`. See [`case-studies/README.md`](case-studies/README.md).

| # | Study | What it teaches | Runnable |
|---|-------|-----------------|----------|
| 01 | [Order Book Matching](case-studies/01-order-book-matching/) | Two orderings, two structures; earning a heap then a tick-indexed ladder via BUD | [`matching_engine.py`](case-studies/01-order-book-matching/matching_engine.py) |
| 02 | [Grounded SQL Agent](case-studies/02-grounded-sql-agent/) | Schema grounding measured by ablation, bounded self-correction, a deterministic safety gate | [`safety_gate.py`](case-studies/02-grounded-sql-agent/safety_gate.py) |
| 03 | [Exactly-Once Event API](case-studies/03-exactly-once-event-api/) | Constraint-based dedup, atomic claims, and what at-most-once actually buys | [`event_api.py`](case-studies/03-exactly-once-event-api/event_api.py) |
| 04 | [K-Means Optimization](case-studies/04-kmeans-optimization/) | Initialization over iteration, and stating an optimization's regime | [`kmeans_ladder.py`](case-studies/04-kmeans-optimization/kmeans_ladder.py) |
| 05 | [Agent Evaluation Harness](case-studies/05-agent-eval-harness/) | Outcome, evidence, and grade kept apart; replay before grading; a checker proved by oracles and mutants | [`eval_harness.py`](case-studies/05-agent-eval-harness/eval_harness.py) |

## Books and Resources

See the [source register](SOURCES.md) for author/publisher evidence and the distinction between free books, course materials, and paid companions. [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) connects the foundational math tracks to regression, PCA, and optimization.

All primary textbooks are free. Recommended (non-free) books are listed separately.
