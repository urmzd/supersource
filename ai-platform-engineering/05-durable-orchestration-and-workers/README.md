## Key Takeaways

- **Durable execution is checkpointing for workflows.** A long-running process persists every completed step so that, after *any* crash, deploy, or scale event, it resumes exactly where it stopped — instead of restarting or corrupting state.
- **The worker pattern decouples "what to do" from "who does it."** A durable workflow engine is a queue of tasks + a pool of stateless workers that poll, execute, and report back. Scale by adding workers; survive failures because tasks are persisted, not in-flight memory.
- **Recovery is replay over an event log.** Temporal/Cadence reconstruct a workflow's state by replaying its event-sourced history — the same event-sourcing pattern from the data topic, applied to *execution* instead of data.
- **Idempotency and compensation are non-negotiable.** Retries are guaranteed, so every step must be safe to repeat; when you can't roll forward, the **saga** runs compensating actions to undo partial work.
- **Distributed observability and profiling are how you operate this.** A workflow spanning services and hours is invisible without tracing (where is it?), metrics (how many are stuck?), and profiling (why is this step slow?).

## How to Study

- Build a 3-step pipeline (download → embed → index) as a Temporal or DBOS workflow. Kill the worker mid-run; watch it resume without redoing completed steps. *That* is durable execution.
- Make a step non-idempotent (e.g. "charge the card") and run it through a forced retry — observe the double-charge bug, then fix it with an idempotency key.
- Add a compensation (refund) and trigger a downstream failure to see the saga unwind.
- Instrument the workflow with OpenTelemetry traces and profile the slowest activity — find where the wall-clock time actually goes.

# Concepts & Techniques

## Core Insight

A request lives for milliseconds; a *process* — fulfill an order, ingest and index a corpus, run a multi-day training job — lives for minutes to months, calls flaky services, and must survive the machine running it dying halfway through. The naive solution (a database state column + cron + retry glue) reinvents a buggy workflow engine every time. Durable execution names the pattern: persist the *progress* of a computation (its checkpoints) so the program is, in effect, immortal — it can crash and wake up mid-function with all its local state intact. Everything else here (workers, sagas, observability) is in service of making that illusion reliable and operable.

## 1. The Problem: Long-Running, Failure-Prone Processes

**Key ideas**:
- A real workflow is **multi-step, long-lived, and distributed** — and any step can fail, time out, or be interrupted by a deploy.
- Hand-rolled orchestration scatters state across a DB column, a cron job, a retry wrapper, and a dead-letter queue — correctness lives nowhere and bugs live everywhere.
- The recurring needs: **retry** with backoff, **timeouts**, **idempotency**, **resume-after-crash**, **visibility**, and **rollback**. Durable execution provides all of them as a single abstraction.

## 2. Durable Execution & Checkpointing

**The core pattern**

**Key ideas**:
- **Checkpoint every step.** After each step's result is known, persist it durably *before* moving on. On recovery, read the last checkpoint and continue — never redo completed work.
- **Event-sourced history + replay** (Temporal/Cadence): the engine records an append-only log of every event (step scheduled, step completed, timer fired). To recover, it **replays** that log through your workflow code to rebuild local variables and resume at the next unexecuted line. Your workflow looks like ordinary sequential code; the engine makes it crash-proof underneath.
- **Determinism requirement**: because recovery replays your code, workflow code must be **deterministic** — no `now()`, `random()`, or direct I/O inline; those go through the engine (which records their results) so replay reproduces the same path. This is the one real constraint of the model.
- **Transactional checkpointing** (DBOS): persist workflow/step state in **Postgres transactions**, so recovery is "read the last committed step and continue." Lighter-weight, leans on the database you already run.
- **Parallel to training checkpoints**: the same idea that lets a multi-day GPU training run resume from the last saved checkpoint ([topic 01](../01-training-and-frameworks/)) — applied to arbitrary application workflows.

## 3. The Worker Pattern

**Decoupling task definition from task execution**

**Key ideas**:
- **Task queue + worker pool**: the engine holds a durable queue of pending tasks (workflow steps / activities); a pool of **workers** long-polls the queue, executes a task, and reports the result back. Classic producer-consumer, made durable.
- **Workers are stateless and horizontally scalable**: all durable state lives in the engine, so workers can crash, deploy, and autoscale freely. Add workers → more throughput; lose workers → tasks just wait in the queue.
- **Separation of concerns**: the **workflow** orchestrates (deterministic, the "what and when"); **activities/steps** do the side-effecting work (the "how" — call an API, run a model, write a DB). Activities get automatic retries, timeouts, and heartbeats.
- **Task routing**: route tasks to worker pools by capability (GPU workers vs CPU workers vs region) via named task queues — how you'd send embedding jobs to GPU workers and notifications to cheap CPU workers.
- **This is the same worker pool** as a thread pool, a Celery/Sidekiq queue, or a Kubernetes Job fan-out — durable execution just persists the queue and the progress.

## 4. Reliability Patterns Around Workers

| Pattern | Problem it solves |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Idempotency key** | Retries must not double-apply a side effect (charge, send, insert) |
| **Saga / compensation** | A multi-step transaction across services can't use 2PC; undo completed steps on later failure |
| **Transactional outbox** | Atomically commit a DB change *and* an event to publish (no dual-write inconsistency) |
| **Exactly-once (effectively)** | Combine idempotency + dedup so a step's *effect* happens once despite at-least-once delivery |
| **Circuit breaker / bulkhead** | Stop hammering a failing dependency; isolate failures to one pool |
| **Backpressure** | Bound the queue and shed/slow producers so workers aren't overwhelmed |
| **Poison-message / DLQ** | Quarantine a task that fails forever instead of blocking the queue |

**Key idea**: at-least-once delivery is the cheap, available default; you reach *effectively-once* by making consumers **idempotent** and reconciling with **compensation**. There is no free exactly-once in a distributed system — you engineer it.

## 5. Temporal, Cadence, and DBOS

| | Temporal / Cadence | DBOS |
|---|--------------------|------|
| Recovery model | Event-sourced history + replay | Transactional state in Postgres |
| State store | Cassandra / Postgres / MySQL | Postgres (the one you already have) |
| Execution | Separate worker pool polling a service | Library in your process |
| Strength | Long-lived, complex, signal-driven workflows | Lightweight, SQL-native, fewer moving parts |
| Lineage | Cadence (Uber, OSS) → Temporal (fork) | Postgres-first durable execution |

**Key ideas**:
- **Temporal** is the heavyweight: months-long workflows, signals, child workflows, timers, versioning, multi-language SDKs — at the cost of running a cluster (which itself needs a sharded store; see [topic 04](../04-distributed-data-and-caching/)).
- **Cadence** is the open-source ancestor Temporal forked from; same concepts, less active.
- **DBOS** trades some power for simplicity: if you already run Postgres, you get durable execution without a separate system.
- **vs schedulers**: Airflow/Dagster ([Data Engineering](../../data-engineering/04-orchestration-modeling/)) run *batch DAGs on a schedule*; Temporal/DBOS run *durable arbitrary code* with fine-grained, event-driven, long-lived state. Overlapping, distinct tools.
- **vs distributed-compute frameworks**: **[Ray](https://docs.ray.io/)** (Core actors/tasks, Ray Train, Ray Serve) is the worker-pool pattern for *in-memory distributed ML compute* — fast task/actor scheduling across a cluster, but **not durable** (lose a node mid-task and the task reruns; lose the driver and the job dies). Temporal/DBOS persist progress; Ray maximizes throughput. Common pattern: Ray for the heavy parallel compute *inside* a step, a durable engine to orchestrate the steps reliably around it.

## 6. Distributed Observability

**You cannot operate what you cannot see**

**Key ideas**:
- **The three pillars** ([Observability](../../systems/04-observability/)): **traces** (one request/workflow across services — a span tree), **metrics** (aggregate rates/latencies — RED/USE), **logs** (discrete events). A durable workflow needs all three because it spans services *and time*.
- **Distributed tracing** (OpenTelemetry): propagate a trace/span context across every RPC and queue hop so a workflow's whole path is one connected trace — answering "where is execution #123 right now, and what's it waiting on?"
- **Workflow-native visibility**: durable engines add their own — list running/failed workflows, inspect event history, see which step is retrying. Temporal's event log *is* an audit trail and a debugger.
- **Correlation IDs**: thread a workflow/correlation id through logs, metrics, and traces so you can pivot between them.

## 7. Profiling

**Measure before you optimize — at every layer**

**Key ideas**:
- **Profiling vs observability**: observability tells you *which* request/step is slow; profiling tells you *why* — where the CPU cycles, allocations, or wait-time actually go inside it.
- **CPU profiling**: sampling profilers + **flame graphs** (Brendan Gregg) — read the widest frames; that's where time goes. (`py-spy`, `pprof`, `perf`, async-profiler.)
- **The USE method**: for every resource check **U**tilization, **S**aturation, **E**rrors — a systematic way to find the bottleneck instead of guessing.
- **Latency vs throughput, p50 vs p99**: tail latency is where users feel pain; profile the p99 path, not the average. Workers make this concrete — a few slow activities drag the whole workflow's wall-clock.
- **The discipline**: form a hypothesis → measure → confirm → fix → re-measure. The bottleneck is almost never where intuition first points (it's usually I/O wait, lock contention, or an N+1, not "the algorithm").

## Depth: partitioned consumers

> Formerly the separate topic `infrastructure/03-distributed-workers` (merged here by the course consolidation). The durable engine above owns *workflow* state; this section is the other common worker shape: a pool of consumers reading a partitioned log (Kafka), where the partition, not the engine, decides who does what. The runnable consumers and a hands-on lab are the side quest [`side-quests/kafka-consumers/`](side-quests/kafka-consumers/). Read [Messaging & Distributed Queueing](../../infrastructure/02-messaging-and-queueing/) first for the dynamics (queue vs log, push vs pull, delivery semantics).

### The partition is the unit of everything

A **worker** is a process that pulls work off a log and does it. Once you accept at-least-once delivery ([Messaging & Distributed Queueing](../../infrastructure/02-messaging-and-queueing/)), the entire job becomes operational: distribute partitions across a pool, keep the group stable through joins and leaves, make handlers tolerate redelivery, contain poison messages, and size the pool to the backlog. The unifying constraint is the **partition**: it is simultaneously the unit of ordering, the unit of assignment, and the **ceiling on useful parallelism** within a group.

![Kafka partitions, consumer groups, and the parallelism cap](side-quests/kafka-consumers/kafka-consumption.svg)

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Topic: orders (4 partitions)"
        P0[p0]; P1[p1]; P2[p2]; P3[p3]
    end
    subgraph "Group: order-workers"
        W0[worker-0]; W1[worker-1]; W2[worker-2]; W3[worker-3]; W4[worker-4 IDLE]
    end
    P0-->W0; P1-->W1; P2-->W2; P3-->W3
    style W4 fill:#cfcfcf,color:#444,stroke-dasharray: 4
```

The 5th worker is **idle** -- there is no partition left to own. This is the single most important operational fact about Kafka scaling, and it is why the KEDA replica cap ([Containers, Kubernetes & Workloads](../../infrastructure/01-containers-kubernetes/)) is the partition count.

### 1. Partition count = the parallelism ceiling

- Within one consumer group, **each partition is owned by exactly one consumer.** A consumer may own several partitions; a partition is never split across two consumers in the same group.
- Therefore **useful parallelism ≤ partition count.** Workers beyond the partition count get no assignment and sit idle, burning resources for nothing.
- Pick partition count for your *peak* worker count plus headroom. Over-partitioning costs metadata and end-to-end latency; under-partitioning permanently caps throughput.
- **Adding partitions later breaks key→partition stability** (the hash target changes), so events for `order_id=42` can land on a different partition than before -- reordering relative to history. Forecast partitions ahead of time rather than reactively.

### 2. Consumer groups & rebalancing -- the thing that bites you

When a consumer joins, leaves, or dies, the group **rebalances**: partitions are reassigned across surviving members. The mechanics cause real incidents.

- **Eager (stop-the-world) rebalancing.** The classic protocol revokes *all* partitions from *all* members, then reassigns from scratch -- consumption pauses across the entire group during the reassignment. Cheap to reason about, expensive in availability.
- **Cooperative / incremental rebalancing** ([KIP-429](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-429%3A+Kafka+Consumer+Incremental+Rebalance+Protocol), `CooperativeStickyAssignor`) revokes *only* the partitions that must move and lets everyone else keep consuming. No global stall. Use it for any group where a stop-the-world pause hurts -- which is most of them. This is what [`code/consumer-go.go`](side-quests/kafka-consumers/consumer-go.go) and its siblings configure.
- **Slow-handler false rebalances.** If you don't call `poll()` within `max.poll.interval.ms`, the broker assumes the consumer is dead and *kicks it*, triggering a rebalance and reprocessing of its partitions. A handler that occasionally takes 6 minutes on a 5-minute interval will flap the whole group. Fixes: keep handlers fast, lower `max.poll.records` so each poll batch finishes in time, or raise the interval to cover the worst case.
- **Clean leave on SIGTERM.** On scale-down or rollout, Kubernetes sends `SIGTERM`. A worker that traps it and `Close()`s the consumer **leaves the group cleanly**, so its partitions are reassigned *immediately*. A worker that is just killed leaves the group to wait out `session.timeout.ms` before noticing it's gone -- a window of stalled partitions. This is the consumer side of graceful shutdown from [Containers, Kubernetes & Workloads](../../infrastructure/01-containers-kubernetes/) (trap SIGTERM → stop new work → finish in-flight → commit → exit). All three `code/consumer-*` examples implement it.

### 3. Idempotency & atomic state changes

Because delivery is at-least-once ([Messaging & Distributed Queueing](../../infrastructure/02-messaging-and-queueing/)), every handler must tolerate seeing the same message twice.

- **Idempotency key (`SETNX`).** Before doing the work, claim the message's natural key: Streamflow's `order-worker` does `SETNX order_id` in Redis (with a TTL). If the key already exists, this is a redelivery -- skip the work and let the offset advance. This is the [Idempotent Receiver](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/IdempotentReceiver.html) pattern; the Redis dependency appears in the C4 component diagram from [Containers, Kubernetes & Workloads](../../infrastructure/01-containers-kubernetes/).
- **Transactional outbox.** The "wrote to the DB but crashed before producing the event" hole is real. Fix it by writing business state *and* the outgoing event into the *same* database transaction (an `outbox` table); a separate relay (or CDC) reads the outbox and publishes. State and event now commit atomically -- no lost or phantom events. See [microservices.io: Transactional Outbox](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html).
- **Commit offsets only after durable work**, and **batch commits** for throughput. Committing before the work is at-most-once (loss on crash); committing after is at-least-once (duplicate on crash, absorbed by the idempotency key). The examples set `enable.auto.commit=false` and commit explicitly after `handle()` returns.

### 4. Failure handling: retries, poison messages, and the DLQ

- **Retryable vs poison.** A *transient* failure (DB blip, downstream timeout) → retry with backoff; it will likely succeed. A *poison* message (malformed, references deleted data, fails a hard invariant) will **never** succeed -- retrying it forever blocks the partition behind it. Because ordering is per-partition, a stuck message is **head-of-line blocking**: everything behind it on that partition waits.
- **Dead-letter queue (DLQ).** After N attempts, route the poison message to an `orders.DLQ` topic and move on, unblocking the partition. **Alert on DLQ depth**; a human or a repair job drains it. The DLQ edge appears in the Streamflow container diagram ([Containers, Kubernetes & Workloads](../../infrastructure/01-containers-kubernetes/)).
- **Tiered retry topics.** Rather than blocking live traffic with in-line backoff, some designs route transient failures to staged retry topics (`orders.retry.5s`, `orders.retry.1m`, `orders.retry.10m`), each consumed by a delayed worker. Live consumption never stalls; retries escalate through the tiers; whatever survives all tiers lands in the DLQ.
- **Bound per-message time.** One slow handler must not block the batch -- set a per-message deadline and DLQ the overrun, or you reintroduce the slow-handler rebalance from §2.

### 5. Sizing & operating the worker pool

- **Partitions = max parallelism.** (§1.) Size partition count for peak workers plus headroom; you cannot scale useful workers past it.
- **Lag is the master signal.** Consumer **lag** = log-end offset − committed offset = "messages behind." It is the right input for both alerting and autoscaling, because it directly measures whether the pool is keeping up (unlike CPU, which a blocked-on-I/O worker leaves low while lag explodes).
- **KEDA scales on lag.** [Containers, Kubernetes & Workloads](../../infrastructure/01-containers-kubernetes/) wires a KEDA `ScaledObject` to consumer-group lag: lag rises → KEDA raises worker replicas (capped at the partition count) → the Cluster Autoscaler adds nodes if pods are Pending → new members join → a rebalance assigns them partitions → lag drains. KEDA can also scale to **zero** when idle.
- **At the cap, add partitions, not pods.** When lag keeps rising but replicas already equal the partition count, more pods do nothing (they sit idle, §1). The lever is *more partitions* (and a one-time reshuffle of key→partition mapping). This is the cap referenced by the Kubernetes topic's scaling story.

### Technique Catalog

| Technique | When to apply |
|-----------|---------------|
| One consumer per partition (group sizing) | Always -- never run more workers than partitions |
| Cooperative/incremental rebalancing | Any group where stop-the-world stalls hurt |
| Tune `max.poll.records` / `max.poll.interval.ms` | When handlers are slow enough to risk false rebalances |
| Clean leave on SIGTERM | Every worker (fast partition reassignment on scale-down) |
| Idempotency key (SETNX) | Deduping redelivered messages |
| Transactional outbox | Atomic "update state + emit event" |
| Commit after durable work + batch commits | Every at-least-once consumer |
| Dead-letter queue | Any consumer that can receive poison messages |
| Tiered retry topics | When in-line retries would block live traffic |
| Scale on consumer lag (KEDA) | Sizing the worker pool to backlog |
| Add partitions (not pods) at the cap | When lag rises with replicas already = partitions |

## Patterns Worth Internalizing

- **Persist progress, then proceed** — checkpoint each step so the computation is crash-proof; recover by reading the last durable state (or replaying the log).
- **Queue + stateless worker pool** — push all state into a durable store so workers become disposable and horizontally scalable.
- **At-least-once + idempotency = effectively-once** — there's no free exactly-once; engineer it with keys, dedup, and compensation.
- **Saga, not 2PC, across services** — roll forward where you can, compensate where you can't.
- **Trace across hops, profile within them** — observability locates the slow thing; profiling explains it. Measure before optimizing, every time.
