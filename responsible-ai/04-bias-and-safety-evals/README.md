## Key Takeaways

- **Bias is measured as a difference**: the same prompt template with only a group term changed, scored on the same metric, with a confidence interval on the gap.
- **Safety evals need a scorer you trust**: a deterministic one (a lexicon, a classifier with known precision) before an LLM judge.
- **Small models fail differently, not less.** A 10M-parameter story model will not produce dangerous instructions, but it will reproduce stereotypes from its corpus; measure what your model can actually do.
- **An eval is a test**: fixed prompts, fixed seeds, a threshold, and a place in the release gate.

## How to Study

Read BBQ and RealToxicityPrompts, then the HELM sections on bias and toxicity metrics. In the course, `ethics.04` is a build module: you write paired-template bias evals and a toxicity scorer in Python, run them through `EvalSuite`, and report the results in the model card.

# Concepts & Techniques

## Core Insight

A fairness or safety claim is only as good as its measurement. Paired templates isolate the effect of one attribute; bootstrap intervals separate a real gap from noise; and running the suite on every release candidate turns a one-time audit into a regression test.

## 1. Measuring bias

**Key ideas**:
- **Paired templates**: identical prompts differing in one group term; compare log-likelihoods or completions.
- **Uncertainty**: a paired bootstrap interval on the difference, as in `M07.5`; report the interval, not just the point estimate.

## 2. Measuring safety

**Key ideas**:
- **Toxicity and refusal rates** on fixed prompt sets with seeded sampling.
- **Where it runs**: the `EvalSuite` workflow (`dur.11`) and the release gate (`dur.12`); results land in the model card (`ethics.03`).
